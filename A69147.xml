            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR AS MVCH (DEERELY</hi> beloued in oure ſauiour Ieſu) as faith (which is the gift of god without the which we canne not pleaſe god) cometh by hearing of the worde of god, it is expedient,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.

            <p>We may not at our pleaſure (as the world doth) trifle with it, neglecte it and contemne it, which is the lyuely foode of the ſowle, as Chriſte himſelfe by the ſame beareth wineſſe, ſaynge:<note place="margin">Mat. 4</note> 
               <hi>A man ſhall not lyue by breade only, but by euery worde that procedeth out of the mouthe of God.</hi> What manne neglecteth the foode and noriſhmente of his bodye, whiche is mortall, vyle earth, and wormes meate? Nay, howe do all men diligently awayte the tyme, ſeaſon and oportunitye to prepare the foode and noryſhmente for the body?</p>
            <p>The huſband man ploweth, ſoweth, barroweth, weedeth, reapeth, moweth, dryeth his corne, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth it into his barne in ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>The marchaunte marketh the oportunitye, and taketh the winde that ſerueth for his vyage in due tyme.</p>

               <hi>I haue nouriſhed and brought vppe children, but they haue doone wyckedly againſt me. The oxe hath knowen his owner, and the aſſe his maiſters cribbe, but Iſrael hath receiued no know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge, my people hath no vnderſtandinge. Alas for thys ſynfull nacion, a people of greate iniquitye, a frowarde generation, vnnaturall chyldren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe leaſt any manne flattering him ſelfe, wold apply this lamentable prophecy only vnto the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, let him note this ſentence which toucheth the cauſe of our blyndeneſſe to be twiſe reherſed, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Iſrael hath receiued no knowledg, my people hath no vnderſtandinge.</hi> If it had beene ſpoken only of the Iewes, yt had beene ynough to haue ſaide, <hi>Iſraell hathe receiued no knowledge,</hi> But bicauſe it ſhulde be truely applyed vnto vs alſo, god ſaith: <hi>My peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath no vnderſtanding.</hi>

            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:9767:3"/>
            <p>Wherfore (chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reader) it hath been thought good, to commend this ſmall volume of godlye and ſincere doctrine, into our mother and Engliſh tong that it mighte be a ſpurre vnto the dull ſhepherds, and helpe vnto the ſimple and godlye mynded cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and comforte to the fathers of the houſhold, parents, and gouernoures of youth. Truly it muſt needes be a ſpurre vnto the ydle, dul and negligent curates, bicauſe the doctrine hereof is ſo brief, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and plaine, that a cyllye woman or poore pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyſe, occupyinge theim ſelues the whole weeke in their vocacion, onlye with the ſtudyinge and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of this booke vpon the ſondaye and hollye daye, ſhall within one yeare be better able to teach hereafter their own houſholdes, then many curats do now inſtructe their congregacion committed to their cure and charg. At whoſe hand, without fayl,<note place="margin">Ezec. 3. and .33.</note> the Lorde wyll requyre the bloude of euerye one of their flock that periſheth for lack of godly teching.</p>
            <p>Alſo the profite that the godlye mynded curates (although they be but meanly learned) ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obtaine their flocke and congregacion in ſhorte tyme (by the grace of God) ſhall better declare in their lyfe by good frutes, than here can be expreſſed with woordes.</p>
            <p>Finally, the honeſt houſholders, (for whoſe ſake principally this booke is putte forth,) whiche wyll take paines to practiſe the doctrine herof vpon the ſondayes and holy dayes in teachinge their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, and lookinge to them ſo on the working daies with diſcipline, that they exercyſe the ſame in their lyfe, ſhall fynde more faithfulnes, quieteneſſe, and
<pb facs="tcp:9767:4"/> obedience in their families, then their policie and worldely wyſedome otherwyſe is able to bryng to paſſe with all that they can do.</p>
            <p>Let not parentes and mayſters hereafter fynde faulte with the pryde, ſtubburneſſe, ſlouthe, and falſhed of their youthes &amp; ſeruauntes, if they theim ſelues be ſtyffe necked and ſlowe to learne the word of the Lord, and negligent in teachyng their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to ſerue God. But let them knowe, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>towardneſſe of their youth &amp; ſeruauntes is the iuſt plague of god vnto them, becauſe they teache them not to knowe, feare and ſerue God.</p>
            <p>What meane they that murmure? would they haue their children and ſeruantes obedient, fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diligente to ſerue theim? Yea verely, it is mete they ſhould ſo be. Then lette they them ſelues begynne fyrſt to be diligent in learnyng the worde of God, faythful in teachyng it, and obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng it.<note place="margin">Tit. 2.</note> For S. Paul ſayth: <hi>Speake the thinges that be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>come wholſome learnyng, that the elder men bee ſober, ſage, diſcrete, ſound in the fayth, in loue, and in pacience.</hi> When they haue learned this, than let them be dili<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gent to ſhewe the ſame by example, and to teache their cure, that whiche foloweth.</p>
            <p>Fyrſt, <hi>that their wyues be in ſuche apparel as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth holynes, not geuen to muche wyne, ſobre minded, diſcrete, chaſt, howſewyfly, good, obedyent to their own huſbandes, dilygent in teaching their chyldren, that the worde of God be not euel ſpoken of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondarily, <hi>that yonge men be ſobre mynded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thyrdly, <hi>that ſeruantes be obedient vnto their own maiſters, and pleaſe them in all thinges, not anſweringe
<pb facs="tcp:9767:4"/> againe, neither pickers, but they muſt ſhew al faithfulnes, that they may do worſhip to the doctrine of God our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in all thinges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus dyd Adam (after hee was called to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce) teache his children, fyrſte to knowe theyr ſauiour and to ſerue god in true faith: as witneſſeth the oblation of his obedient ſonne Abell.<note place="margin">Gene. 4</note>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo Seth and Enos did the ſame, and therfore it is written of them, that they began to make inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion in the name of the Lord.<note place="margin">Gene. 5</note> Lykewiſe Henoch of whom it is written, that hee walked with God.</p>
            <p>Noe thereby was not onely ſaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drownyng,<note place="margin">Gen. 7.</note> but alſo hath obtained this godly title, euen to bee called, <hi>The preacher of righteouſnes.</hi>

            <p>What neede I to ſpeake of Abraham, Loth, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac, Iacob, Ioſeph, &amp;c. which in ſteed of preachers retained the true faith, ſuerly grounded vpon god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des woorde, and by good exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple and doctrine haue taughte the ſame to their families and poſterytie? A noble example to all gouernoures, parentes and mayſters is ſet forth in Tobie,<note place="margin">Tob. 1.</note> which (as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) taught his ſonne from his youthe vp, to feare god, and to refraine from euell. And to the end that no manne ſhould wante the godly leſſons that hee taught, lo here they folow.<note place="margin">Tobi. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Haue god in thy thought all the dayes of thy lyfe, and beware at any tyme thow co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Gyue almes of thy goodes, and turne neuer thy face from the poore, and ſo ſhal it come to paſſe, that the face of the Lorde ſhall not be turned away from the. Be mercifull after thy power. Yf thow haue muche, gyue plenteouſely. Yf thou haue

            </p>
            <p>Laſte of all, hee departed this lyfe in peace, but yet before he ſhould depart, he called vnto him his ſonne, &amp; his ſonnes vii. children, ſaiyng: <hi>My children,</hi>

For ſaynct Paule by ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes declared his faith, and lette paſſe diuerſe other of his good workes: what thinke you of that, wher he dyd ſocoure and helpe: that poore and miſerable Oneſmus?

Forthermore the ſame good ſaint Paule took on hym ſelfe the harme, whiche the ſame fugitiue ſeruaunt had done his mayſter, and wolde all the loſſe (whatſoeuer it were) to be layde on his necke Be not theſe good workes? But by it that other workes do appeare greate and good, yet may thei not well be called good workes, whan they, which haue neede of them, be not releuyd by them. Good workes muſt alway ſerue thy neyghboure, &amp; hym that hath need.<note place="margin">Chriſt in the middeſt of his oy lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted &amp; wepte</note> And that Chriſt teacheth vs in this ſtory, when in the middeſt of the peoples ioy, which reioyſed and wiſhed all thinges proſperous vnto him, as to the ſon of Dauyd, &amp; to their power gaue hym the moſte honoure they could, he wepte very

Verely as he him ſelfe witneſſeth the miſery and wretchednes of the people entred in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to his hert, for ſeing that by al the time that he was ſo conuerſaunte amongeſt them, they wolde not vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtand nor receiue knowledge, it was neceſſarye that thei in body, ſoule, honour, and all their goods ſhuld periſhe. All this knewe Chriſt, and therefore wepte ſo ſore. And beſides this, he faithfully gaue monicion vnto them before, whereby they mighte learne to auoyd ſuch inconuenience: but all was in vayne. Now lyke as Chriſt doth not diſemble, but by all meanes goeth aboute to preuente the loſſe of his people, ſo ſhulde we when we are come to the knowledg of God, take vpon vs the care and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſitie of our neighbour, whether it be bodely or goſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye, great or ſmall, &amp; to procure not only, that there ryſe or growe no hurt vnto them or theires, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that they feele our help at need.

And confeſſed that he was not Chriſt, knowledging that the honoure of that name was meete for no mortall man, but for Chriſt alone, for whome he came to prepare his waye before. And moreouer he wold not be taken for Helias, for they
<pb facs="tcp:9767:16"/> demaunded of Helias Theſbites,<note place="margin">4.

Nowe lyke as it is to bee noted, with howe noble a conſtancye S. Iohn was endued, ſo is it likewiſe to be conſydered, howe hardely the ſame good man was temptyd and oppoſed.</p>

I praye you, who wolde not haue bene moued with the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie of ſuche greate men? ſo noble imbaſſadours and with ſo highe commendacion of honoure, as they gaue to S. Iohn. But S.

For the fruicte of this calling, is, that the worde of God be purely &amp; ſincerely delyuered out, as thou maieſt ſe in Aaron, Eſaias, Chriſte, the Apoſtels, and other faithfull miniſters. Howe often times doth Chriſt in the 5.<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.</note> &amp; 6. and all other chapters of S.

<pb facs="tcp:9767:17"/> Thou ſeeſt the fruites of this manner of callynge But Iohn that he might ſhewe his callynge to bee of God, ſaide. (For they loked for an anſwere,) I am the voice of one that cryeth in wildernes &amp;c. As though he ſhulde ſay: Ye knowe by the prophet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,<note place="margin">Eſa. 40</note> that one ſhall come before Meſſias to prepare his way. And ye can not be ignoraunt in that, that he that ſhal come in that place, ſhalbe called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voice of one that crieth in the wildernes. Euen the verye ſame voyce am I. And for that cauſe am I ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, nor of my ſelfe do I anye thinge that I doo. Nowe euen as the miniſter ſente from God muſte preache the worde of God, accordinge to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of S.

I cal the fleſhe the hole nature of man, which of him ſelfe bringeth forth none other fruictes, then ſynne,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3</note> as ſcripture ſaieth in the 3. chapter of Iohn. That that is conceiued and borne of fleſhe, is fleſh. Of this thinge thou haſte heere a goodly exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. There came to Iohn that paſſed all other of the Iewes in learnynge and behauioure, and they had herde who ſente him to preach and bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſe: and that of the prophete, that with them was chiefeſt: yet dyd they not vnderſtande S. Iohn. Whereby thou mayſt perceyue, that the knowledg of God and Chriſte oure ſauioure commeth not throughe oure power and ſtrength, but by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Chriſte. It is the gifte of God, leſte any
<pb facs="tcp:9767:17"/> man ſhoulde glory thereof in him ſelfe. Thy wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is very fooliſhe before God, for ſo ſcripture ſayeth.

                  <p>Fourthly S. Iohn putteth a difference betwene his baptiſme &amp; the baptiſme of Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith: I baptiſe in water and preach penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwene the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of Iohn &amp; the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of Chriſte.</note> But Chriſt doth not only paptiſe in water, but alſo forgeueth ſyn, &amp; ſendeth the holy ghoſt. Mark here that S. Iohn putteth no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwen y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> outward ſigne of water that he miniſtreth, &amp; the ſame that Chriſt vſeth. The exteriour ſigne, both of Chriſte and S. Iohn is al one, for S. Iohn preacheth the worde of God and baptiſeth with water, as alſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels doo.<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> But S. Iohn maketh a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene his perſone and office,<note place="margin">The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſte.</note> and the office and perſon of Chriſte. For Chriſt (as is ſaide before) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydes that, that he preacheth and baptiſeth, doth al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo by his owne power, forgeue ſynnes, and ſend the holy ghoſte, that ſhal lighten and renewe our hartꝭ which Iohn cannot doo, but by his miſterye. And this is the cauſe whye he doth ſo greatlye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende and prayſe Chriſte, for that he is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lambe of God, that takethe awaye the ſynne of the worlde. And likewiſe yt is he, that was before me, and ſhall come after me: as who ſaieth: He is more then Iohn, and forgeueth ſynne, alſo
<pb facs="tcp:9767:18"/> I am not worthy to loſe the latchet of his ſhowe Is not this the verye waye to knowe, prayſe, and deſcribe Chriſt? And yet when wee are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, wee be baptiſed bothe with the baptiſme of Iohn and Chriſte alſo,<note place="margin">The lawe is fyrſte preched</note> that is, It is neceſſary, that that olde Adame be layed vnder feete (as it is ſignified by that outwarde ſigne) before Chriſt dothe baptiſe in fyer and the ſpirite. Moreouer wee muſte alſo come to the knowledge of ſynne by Iohnes preachyng. And when we be brought in this wiſe to the knowledge of our ſinne, then Chriſte fyndeth place for the exerciſing of hys of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to remitte ſynnes, and geue into our hartes the holye ghoſte, which he will do accordyng to S.

Where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary that euen as the euangeliſt hath deſcribed the ſame natiuitie or birthe, ſo likewiſe, that euerye manne doo receaue it into the inwarde partes of his harte, and often tymes to reuolue it in himſelfe, whereby he may by the meditacion of ſuch thinges be kendeled, lyghtened, and made ioyful, and that they maye take and kepe in theyr hertes, the chylde newelye borne, by the worde of faith: For the lower and poorer that this byrthe appeareth to the worlde,<note place="margin">Eſa. 9.</note> ſo muche the holſomer and more profitable it is to them, that receau it by faith.

For it is very euident, and can by no meanes be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, that ſeyng the law is ſpirituall, it doth not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly require outwarde workes, but muche ſoner the inward affections of the hart.

Now therefore it is neceſſarye, other the lawe to be fulfilled, or elſe vs to be damned, as ſcripture ſaith: Curſed bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man, that abideth not in all thinges written in the booke of lawe.

Paule ſaith, In whome euery man that beleueth, ſhalbe ſaued. And in an other place, When the time was fully come, God ſent doune his ſonne borne of a woman &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dued to the lawe,<note place="margin">Abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the lawe.</note> that he ſhulde redeme ſuche, as wer in daunger of the law, and ſo we ſhuld be made
<pb facs="tcp:9767:25"/> the children of God. And hereto it pertaineth, that Chriſt ſuffered himſelfe to be circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſed. This thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g betokeneth, that Chriſte came to fulfil the lawe for vs, and to make vs free from the curſe of the law, that by the doctryne of the goſpell, he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate vnto vs the holy ghoſt that we ſo by, him renewed, myght hereafter, not conſtrayned, but frely and louingely do thoſe thinges, that God requireth of vs.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondarely it is to be vnderſtand and kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wen, that circumciſion was a token and ſigne of the promiſe that God made vnto Abraham,<note place="margin">Signes cofirme faith.</note> yea and to his ſeede alſo, as apeareth in the 17. chap. of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis. Nother was this ſigne geuen that men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by myght bee iuſtified, but that they, which ſhulde heare of the promiſe of God, ſhulde be confirmed in faith, and that the Iewes might be knowen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thother Heythen and infideles. For trewly euerye ſigne hath his promiſe, whereunto it is meete, that all men ſticke and beleue, As in the 6. chap. of Gen. it is promiſed to Noe, that he ſhall not periſhe by the floude: And in token of that promiſe, he had a ſhip, which he was commaunded of God to builde And in the 9. chap. of the ſame alſo, it is promiſed, that the worlde after that, ſhulde neuer be drowned or deſtroyed by floude. And in token thereof, God gaue vnto hym the rayn bow. And in lyke caſe it is here. God promiſed himſelfe to be the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ham and of his ſede. And therefore gaue vnto hym the token of circumciſion, wherewith he dothe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and certefie his faith, that he ſhuld in no wiſe doubt, but ſuerely beleue, that God wolde kepe his promiſe. But thou muſt ſo vnderſtand theſe things

They be al lyuely examples that be here layde before vs. Fyrſt, the benefyt of loue and beneuolence of Chriſt is conferred to the leper. For at his inſtaunce and deſyre, Ieſus put forth his hand and touched him, ſaying: I will be thou cleane. O what great clemencye here is. As ſone as the lepper had ſpoken one word, and aſked helth, Chriſt by and by was redy and holpe hym. Further marke, that this word, I wyll,<note place="margin">I wyll.</note> is nother vayne nor ydell, but full of comfort: For ſuche pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſe as he made to the leper by the ſame worde, he wolde generally to be a promiſe to vs all, whereby he certefieth &amp; ſtrengneth our hartes alſo, that wee ſhould not dought but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is ready in all neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, without any denay to geue vs his continual helpe.

And ſuch a faith was in the Centurion.

And although he do not with expreſſe wordes (as he did in the laſt goſpell) ſaye: I wyll. yet he declared in the thing it ſelfe, that he wyl helpe, when he did ſo ſoone at the requeſte of the Apoſtels, ceaſe the tempeſt.</p>
                  <p>Out of this is place to be noted, that Chriſt doth call and alure vs many wayes to hym. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme by expreſſe words ſpeaking, as in the 11. cha. of Math. Come to me all you that labour and bee laden, and I ſhall refreſhe you.<note place="margin">Howe Chryſte doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure vs to hym.</note> and ſometymes by preuy ſteringes and prouocacions through his mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racles and workes, as in the goſpell of this daye. Lette it be what wayes ſoeuer he thinketh beſt, ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rely this maye wee well learne of yt, that Chriſte wyll helpe and comforte vs, in all manner of perill and ieoperdy, both of body and ſowle, ſo that we wyll tarry with him in the ſhyp, that is,<note place="margin">Whal is to be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhyppe.</note> yf we be ioyned wholye to hym by faith.

                  <p>Secondarly, this goſpell teacheth vs, howe to knowe the trewe faith from fained faith, namelye by the croſſe and perſecution. Douteleſſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels were in that opinion, when they entred the ſhip with Chriſte, that they had very perfect faith, and could by no manner temptacion or perſecution be brought from the ſame. But what did they, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neceſſitie and lykelehod of death drewe neare vnto them?<note place="margin">By the croſſe faithe is proued.</note> What conſtancye was there nowe in them? None at all. There was nothing but greate feare, tremblinge and diſperacion. They remembred not that they had with them in the ſhippe the lorde of wyndes and of the ſea, but (as we may ſee in ſaynte Marke the Euangeliſt) they verely thought that God cared nothing at al for them,<note place="margin">Mar. 4.</note> and that he had cleane forſaken them, that he alſo being a ſlepe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not what became of them. Wherefore they ſaye: Maiſter, doeſt thou not care that we periſh? Lo, here thou heareſt of nothinge, but vnbeliefe. Here it is to be noted,<note place="margin">Whye god pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth his electe.</note> that al the temptacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the electe, be ſo ordeined of God, that they ſhal worke to them all for the beſt, wherwith he doth chaſten and bridle the ferſenes and ſecuritye of the fleſh, &amp; doth teach them, that they be not proude or high myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but to know, that all that they can do, muſt be referred to god. For we know how bolde and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious the fleſhe is, if it be not made lowe, and with ſuch ſcourges and ſtripes brought to pacience and humility.<note place="margin">Mat 26</note> Dyd not alſo S. Peter boldly ſay of him ſelfe, that he was readye euen to dye with Chriſte?
<pb facs="tcp:9767:41"/> And did not the children of Zebedeus ſtifly affirme that they coulde drinke of the ſame cup that Chriſt ſhoulde drinke of? Trewly there was preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Mat. 20</note> but a proued faith, there was not. And in lyke ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner be all we affectianate, withoute that through the inſpiration of the holy ghoſt, our infirmitie bee ſtrengthned. We do ſpeake very highely, and with great expectacion of the goſpel, of the croſſe, of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, &amp; ſuch other like, but when we ſe the croſſe euen at hande, when we ſhuld then ſtriue and wag battayle with ſinne, death, the deuel and hel, then be we very could and cowardes and vnprofitable, and then dooe we with the deede perceaue, that we neuer had trew faith, nor euer were ſincerely in our myndes affectionat towards the goſpell. Now they that in the croſſe, in perſecution, in tribulacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and in peril will ſo ſoone flee from Chriſt and deny him, and will not ſuffre ſo ſmall ieoperdye or perill for his ſake if neede were, and ſo continew alwaies in the ſame, they neuer had one crome of ſincere &amp; trewe faith, but rather a ſhadow or vyſard of faith. Therefore they ſhal ſay in the latter day when God ſhall ſaye:<note place="margin">Iohn. 2. Mat. 26</note> Get ye hence from me ye wicked and cur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed into the euerlaſting fyer. But they that in their owne conſcience knowledge, that they do nothinge of their own ſtrength before god, and confeſſe their infirmitie, nor do ſeeke or looke for conſtancye and perſeuerance in the croſſe and perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other wayes, then of god through Chriſt, they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be ſeparated from Chriſte. And although their fayth hath beene many tymes feeble in the tyme of the croſſe and perſecution, yet haue they not allto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb facs="tcp:9767:42"/> fallen into deſpiracion, but hath aſked pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience and peſeueraunce of god. And ſo therby tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rough the helpe of Chriſt, and the vertu of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt, they haue ouercome all their temptacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s So likewiſe did the Appoſtels, when they were w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt in the ſhip for when their faith was ſo weak that they weare not able to ſtriue with temptacion in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very point of death, they then wakened Chriſt, and called vpon him for his helpe, of whom alſo in their ſuche neceſſitie, they had no ſmall comforte. Wherfore I haue tolde you, that it is as neceſſary for faith to be proued by the croſſe, perſecution, and all kindes of trowble, as ſyluer to be tried &amp; pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with fier. For yf ſhe continewe &amp; abide ſtedfaſt in perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then is ſhe a right faith and not fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> and ſhal inherite the kingdom of heauen. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed be they (ſayth Chriſt) that ſuffre perſecution for righteouſneſſe, for they ſhall haue the kingdome of heauen. But yf faith be ſlipper and inconſtante and deny Chriſt, for the fauoure of the world, then ſhall ſhe haue perpetuall damnacion.</p>

And he wente out aboute the thyrd houre, and he ſaw other ſtandyng ydle in the market place, and ſayd vnto them: Go ye alſo into the vineyard, and what ſoeuer is ryghte, I wyll geue you. And they wente theire waye. Agayne he went oure aboute the ſixte and nynthe houre, and dydde lykewyſe.

Paule ſo calleth) the father of mercies,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.</note> as for this opinion muſt we caſt out of our mindes, and only haue reſpecte to the meeke and gentell will of the houſholder: He hath mercy vpon whom he liſt, and who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaſe him,<note place="margin">Rom. 9</note> he doth harden. And to be ſhort, when by his word he calleth me into his vineyard, he maketh me righteouſe &amp; bleſſed, Then muſte I geue thanks to him allonli, ſeing that bi his grace and no merite of myne, it was ſo doone.

For lyke as he by his word cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me to faith, and commaunded me to go into his vineyard of chriſtianite, it is neceſſary,<note place="margin">Rom. 11 Phil. 2.</note> that he giue alſo to me his grace, wherthrough I may abide &amp; perſeuer euen to the end.

And beſides this,<note place="margin">Chriſte came for ſinners Luc. 23.</note> he can of the thefe that hang on the gallowes, make a good and righteous man. In contrarye wiſe, I haue no cauſe to preſume, ſeing that in matters concerning righteouſnes before god, no meryte of workes, but only grace doth preuaile, and muſt alwayes ſay:<note place="margin">Luc. 17</note> And yf I had done all that euer were commaunded me, yet am I but an vnprofitable ſeruaunte, for I haue doone but that I oughte to do. And nowe yf alſo by Chriſte I am iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and indued with the excellente giftes of the holye ghoſte, yet ſhulde I not bee to bolde and looke ouer highe, ſeinge it is ſo with al men,

                  <p>Secondarilye, Chriſte putteth a difference in this goſpell betwene the election of God, wher with he hath predeſtinate all the electe people to euerlaſting lyfe from the beginning of the worlde, &amp; the vacation of fayth, which is by the outwarde word.<note place="margin">Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde worde.</note> And trewly if we do well conſidre and waye the matter, it is no ſmall matter.

And in likewiſe S.

And thoſe whom he hath called, he hath alſo made righteous, &amp; who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath made righteous, he hath glorified alſo. Here we heare that the elect be only iuſtified &amp; glorified by Chriſt.

This doctrin of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; predeſtinacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god, is very horrible to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be
<pb facs="tcp:9767:47"/> drowned in wordely wiſedom, and to theire power do reſiſt the goſpel. For as ſone as thei hear of this doctrine, by and by they deſpiſe and hate it, ſaing: Yf it lye not in mine owne power to be ſaued,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> I wil do what pleaſeth me, and wyll not feare any thing at al. And againe, to them that be ordeined to lyfe, yt is a very helthfull doctrine, and full of comforte They as ſone as they hear that thoſe be only ſaued that bee predeſtinate of God, they meken and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytte them ſelfe, they diſpaire of them ſelfe, they cal for grace &amp; mercy, &amp; by al meanes maketh haſt to Chriſt. And that is euen the very waye to geue to God his honoure. Futhermore they learne, that God of his grace maketh a man not only good, righteous, and bleſſed, but that alſo in all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacions and tribulacions, he wyll comforte and preſerue who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath made righteouſe. But trew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there be very fewe of thoſe, and therefore yt is ſayd of Chriſt, that there be many called, but fewe be eletcte. In Zodome there was not one founde,<note place="margin">Gen. 19</note> but only Loth and his houſeholde: And before the floode, Noah only and his children founde grace.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.

He that is not predeſtinate of God, may not abide nor heare of it:<note place="margin">Iohn. 5</note> And muche leſſe can receaue it. Neuertheleſſe it is thorow our faut, that we be damned. Of electionat this tyme, this ſhalbe ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>What meaneth he when he ſayeth? Many be called. Doughteles he ſpeaketh of the outeward
<pb facs="tcp:9767:48"/> calling to fayth, which is by the word of God. And it was commaunded to the Apoſtels, after the reſurrection: Go youre waye through oute the whole worlde, and preache the goſpell to euery creature, that he that beleueth, and is baptiſed, ſhalbe ſaued. And he that doth not beleue, ſhalbe damned. And hereof ſcripture ſpeaketh in the boke of Pſalmes:<note place="margin">Pſa. 18.</note> Theyr voice ſhall ſounde ouer all the worlde, and their wordes wente to the endes of the world. And althoughe this calling pertaineth vnto many, yet ſumtyme it faileth, and all that be called, abideth not, not that any lack ſhulde be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, wherby we be called, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſo greatly geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our yl affections &amp; luſts, be not drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inwardly by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt, &amp; therfore do we diſpiſe &amp; ſet lytle by this outward callyng, which is by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel.

<pb facs="tcp:9767:48"/> as that whereby we be taught. That by the holye ghoſt, we be drawen. For in the tenth chap. to the Romaynes it is ſayd: Fayth by hearyng &amp;c.<note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and cuſtome of them that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifi the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues.</note>

                  <p>Thirdely, we learne by the grudging of theym, that laboured the whole day for their wages, the cuſtome &amp; nature of them, that iuſtifi them ſelues. They be in lyke manner affectionate as theſe labo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rers were, which of very pride and highe ſtomack, do diſpiſe the latter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers, ſo ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into the vineyard by the houſholder, as though there had ben no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt of wages before. Thei think in themſelfe to be far better then theſe miſerable ſi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners, bicauſe they liued outwardely an honeſt lyfe, and hadde done, (but yet without faith) many workes.

Luke the 18. chap. Likewiſe the elder brother, diſdained his yonger brother that was loſte, when he retorned &amp; came to himſelfe againe.<note place="margin">Mar 14</note> And in like manner Iudas diſpiſed that ſimple &amp; wretched wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man, which in the houſe of Simeon the leper pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red out vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus head, a box of coſtly oyntment. And alſo the Iewes diſpiſed Chriſte, when he didde eate and drinke amongeſte the publicans and ſinners. But what ſayed Chriſte to that? Verely I ſaye vnto you, that ſinners and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ſhall enter into the kingdom of heauen before<note place="margin">Mat. 21</note>

And in this, we miſerable ſinners haue one ſpeciall thing and prerogatiue, before thoſe great high &amp; holy men, that when we do good workes, we haue no reſpect thereto, nor do them for that cauſe, that therefore we may aſke hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen of God, as dewe dette to vs, but wee beleue in hym that maketh the ſinner righteous, and oure fayth is imputed to vs to iuſtificacion.<note place="margin">Rom. 4</note> And forbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the iuſtifiers do aſke their rewarde as dette and couenaunt, and not of grace, therefore yt hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peneth to them, that they be made of the firſte, the laſte: Nor yet ſhal they leaue or forſake their pride ſo grafte in them, which alwaies foloweth them, but alwaies they ſhall iudge and condemne, and often tymes haue in theire mouthes, and call here tyckes, heretickes, vntil they them ſelues be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>

                  <p>Secondarylye, Chriſte ſpeaketh of the ſeede that fell vpon the ſtone, which although it ſprange vp, yet bicauſe it lacked moyſture, it withered awaye. And ſo he declareth, that the ſeed that fel on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtone be thei, that when they hear the word of God, they receiue it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ioy,<note place="margin">To fall from the worde in tyme of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on.</note> but thei haue no rotes bicauſe thei beleue but for a while, &amp; in tyme of temptacion and tribulacion they fall cleane away. Wherin Chriſte ſheweth that his goſpell ſhall neuer bee preached withoute aduerſaries, that ſhall ſtriue againſte it. And lykewiſe, that the perfect and trew faith
<pb facs="tcp:9767:51"/> cannot be knowen, but by tribulacion and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſo proued and tried, as gold and ſiluer is by fier. Yf thou wylt then ſearch &amp; know, what faith I haue, and whether it be a trew or a fayned faith, mark wel &amp; behold my lyfe, when I chaunce to fal into temptacion &amp; tribulacion. And yf then it be a pure and righte fayth, and by the worde of god in my harte made liuelye and effectuall, then muſte I needes ſaye with ſainct Paule:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> I am ſure, that nother death, nor lyfe, nor aungell, nor rule or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, nother things preſent, or thinges to come, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther high, nor low, nor any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of creature, ſhal ſeperate me from the loue of god, that is in Ieſu Chriſt.

And that he expoundeth on this wiſe. The ſeed that fell amongeſt the thornes be they, that haue herd the worde of god, and then
<pb facs="tcp:9767:51"/> thorowgh the cares, ryches, and voluptuoſnes, of this worlde, be ſo ouer growne and choked, that they can not bryng fourth frute. Thow heriſt here repeted, that ſuche heare the word of god: yf then thei heare the word and yet be reiected of Chriſt, I praye the, what is the cauſe, or what lettyth, whye they be not ſaued? verely euen that, be cauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyued not the worde of god erneſtly, and in theyre hartes: and for that they be founde neglegente in fayth, loue, and honeſt conuerſations, and fal from god the creatour vnto creatures. Marke here, how finely Chryſt hath paynted and ſet oute the mindes and harts of riche men: Firſt of all he geueth vnto them cares, for we commonly ſe that the more they haue, the more the couet: as it is ſaid in the 5. cha. Eccleſiaſtes: The couetous man is neuer ſatiſfied of money &amp;c. And he geueth alſo vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the loue and affection of riches, and deſyre of this worldly lyfe. As though he ſhulde ſaye: To haue greate ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doth not damne a man: for there hath beene ſins the beginning of the world, many deuout and holy men, that hath had greate riches, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe haue obtayned euerlaſting lyfe. But to ſette harte and minde in riches, and through them to ſeeke the pleaſures of this lyfe, &amp; not to knowe, that we be but ſeruauntes and ſtewardes of ſuche riches, to thentent, that the poore and nedye maye be holpen thereby, that is the very thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth a man. Wherfore ſeing it is ſo with riche men for the more parte, that they with all theire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence ſeeke and folow the pleaſures of this lyfe, and do not mortefye the fleſhe by the ſpirite, but
<pb facs="tcp:9767:52"/> paſſe ouer their lyfe in all ſecuritie and wealthe of this world.<note place="margin">Mat. 19</note> Chriſt ſayeth alſo in an other place: So<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner may a camell runne thorow the eye of a nedle, then a riche man entre into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And to be briefe, Such rich men,<note place="margin">What condem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth the rich me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and men that abuſe their riches in this world, haue but ſmal prayſe in ſcripture, and in many places we hear of their condemnacion, not bicauſe they haue much riches, or that they be men of great power and might, but for that they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe their ſuch giftes, and take their luſts and plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure in it, and do not make frends to them, of their wicked mammon.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Chriſt ſpeaketh of the ſeede that fell in the good grounde, and ſprang vp, and brought forth fruict an hundreth fold. And that he declared on this wiſe: That that fell in the good ground, be thei which with good hert &amp; mind,<note place="margin">Good grounde</note> do hear y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of god, and kepe the ſame, and bring forth fruict in pacience. And there be two thinges to be noted in that:<note place="margin">Fewe chriſtian men.</note> Firſt, that there be merueilous few chriſtian me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this earth: But of them that in body &amp; ſoule go to the deuel, ther is a great nomber, how highly ſoeuer they pretend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of chriſtians, or boaſte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpell, as Chriſt doth witnes in the 7, chapt. of Mathew, ſaiyng: The gate is larg, and the way is broad that leadeth to perdition, and many there be that entreth into the ſame. But the way that lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth to lyfe is ſtraite, &amp; the gate very narrow, and fewe haue found the ſame. And the other thinge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt ſheweth vs, is this: that although the more parte of menne be euell, and ſo abyde, yet the word of god ſhal not be preached in vaine. In ſome
<pb facs="tcp:9767:52"/> corner there ſhalbe found good ground,<note place="margin">The worde of God is not prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched in vayne.

And although it ſeme, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in vaine, yet muſt we beleue that amongeſt ſo great a company of miſbelieuers, God hath ſome e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lect, that gladly here his worde, and kepe the ſame, although (as we haue ſaide) the numbre of thoſe be very ſmall.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, yt is manifeſt &amp; very plain, that our nature fleſh (when it is not inlyghtened by the holy ghoſt) cannot abide ſtedfaſt in time of perſecution:<note place="margin">The fleſhe hath per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecution</note> for the fleſhe loueth herſelfe, and bitterly hateth perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deliteth more in long and mery dayes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to abide trouble and vexacion with a quiet mynd.

                  <p>Fyrſte, Chriſt proueth by two ſimilitudes that it was impoſſible, that one diuel ſhuld expel an other.

Then for as muche as in the ſteede of this righteouſnes, they taughte the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of workes, and ſoughte ſaluacion by an other meane, then by the ſeede of Abraham, promiſed vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to theim, willing other alſo to ſeke the ſame. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſayd not withoute a cauſe in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this ſimilitude, that they entred not in at the dore, but that they were theues &amp; murtherers. For there cannot be begonne or rayſed vppe in the church greater miſchiefe or murther, then to teache to truſt in workes.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.

And Chriſte called theim hyred ſeruauntes. Wherefore? Forbycauſe they care not for the ſheepe. bycauſe they regarde not the helth and ſaluacion of the ſheepe, neyther wyll daunger them ſelues therfore. And ſo it is written in the prophete:<note place="margin">Soph. 3</note> Her prophetes are lyghte perſones &amp;c.

Surely all only Chriſt is the good ſhepeharde, for he hath got and obteyned for his ſheepe through his death, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and feeding of euerlaſtinge lyfe. Out of this office of Chriſt, we may knowe, what mynde Chriſt beareth toward vs. For he beareth vs ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he will ſaue vs, and not deſtroye vs. Howe doth he confirme that vnto vs? In feedinge, &amp; dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge. Feedyng is in the ſcripture a common terme,<note place="margin">Feding</note> and is as much to ſaye, as to teache goddes word rightly, without mingling therwith falſe doctrine. as thou ſeeſte in the laſte chapiter of Iohn, where Chriſte ſaithe: Peter feede my ſheepe. And in the actes of the apoſtels:<note place="margin">Act. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With this feedinge, with this doctrine, hathe god fyrſte ſerued his ſheepe, and afterwarde, with his death and ſhedinge of his precious blode that they being ſaued for euer, ſhulde not be a praye to
<pb facs="tcp:9767:82"/> the wolues. Who to dye, wolde not beleue ſuche a ſhepharde? Who wolde deſire other feeding? Now compare Chriſt and the hiered ſeruaunte togyther. Chriſte ſeeketh the commoditie and profyte of the ſheepe: The hierelynge ſeeketh his owne wealthe and commoditye. The one hath the worde of lyfe, the other of condemnacion. The one quickeneth, the other ſlayeth. The one refreſheth and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, the other chargeth and troubleth mennes con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſciences. The one abideth with the ſhepe in al need and neceſſitye, and the other flyeth away.

                  <p>Secondarily, wee haue here in this goſpell a meruailous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable ſaying, in that, that Chriſte repeteth that he is the good ſhepeharde &amp;c.

For Chriſte and the father be one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance vndeuided, ſo that Chriſt can not be ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the father, nor the father from Chriſt.

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute thowe mayeſt lyghtelye gather, howe that Chriſte acknowledgeth the father, and lykewyſe howe the father acknowledgeth Chriſte. Nowe If Chriſt knoweth vs, as he knoweth the father, &amp; the father knoweth Chriſte, ſo muſte wee needes be one body and one ſubſtaunce with hym: Yea euen his brethren. Then when I am one body, and one ſubſtaunce with Chriſte my lorde, when I am Chriſtes brother, will not he defend me? wil he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake and leaue me withoute comforte? No ſuerly, but will knowe me, and ſtand by me, vntil the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſumacion and ende of this worlde. So that and if I as a ſhepe were in the middeſt of the wolues, ther were no ieoperdy, only yf this Chriſt wold acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge vs. But howe can I bring that to paſſe, that I may be the brother of Chriſte and grafte in him, and that I maye knowe hym, as he knowethe me? Or howe doth he acknowledge me? Before the foundacion of the worlde was layde, he dyd electe me, and predeſtinate me to ſaluacion,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2</note> of his greate mercye, withoute any deſeruing of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. And after that he became manne, he called me throughe his worde to the ſame ſaluacion, ſo, that yf I nowe beleue in him, he and I bee one. This to beleue frome the botome of oure hartes,<note place="margin">What is to knowe Chriſte.</note> is to knowe Chriſte, in the whiche knowledge conſiſteth oure ryghteouſnes and ſaluacion, as yt is wrytten in the goſpell of Iohn:<note place="margin">Ioh, 17</note> Thys is the euerlaſtynge lyfe, that they knowe the,

But here marke and take hede, in what manner this callyng ſhalbe. Chriſte alone muſt bringe it to paſſe and performe yt, as he ſaithe: I haue yet other ſhepe that be not of this folde, and thoſe ſame muſt I bring alſo &amp;c. Chriſte muſte bringe the gentils, whereout it folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth neceſſarily, that the gentiles of them ſelues, without they be brought by Chriſte, can not come. And yf they can not come of them ſelues, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſt and playne, that we throughe grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye be iuſtified and ſaued, as ſaith S.

Wylte thou become a thefe, and priuily ſteale awaye chriſtes honour? Is it not ſufficient, that the phariſies, thoſe glorifiers in workes, are called theues? If ye are wyſe, take counſayle with the ſcripture, and beleue the ſame, if ye will be ſaued, which ſaith: No man knoweth the father,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14</note> but the ſonne, and to whome the ſonne wil reuele it..

<pb facs="tcp:9767:83"/> alſo. I, I, I my ſelfe muſte bringe them. When Chriſte doth bringe vs through his word and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, then do we heare his voyce, then do we willing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly obey him, and mortefie the old Adame in vs. To make ſhorte, we lyue according to goddes will and pleaſure.

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore in what wiſe through his reſurrection, he ſhuld raign in his kingdome, and go to the father. This ſermon and teaching muſte needes be verye neceſſary, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt ſo oftentimes and with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny wordes repeteth it, and ſheweth yt his diſciples. Yea truly it is very needful, conſidering the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of our fleſh, and the hard vnderſtandynge of theſe articles. Wherefore Chriſte, after the manner of a faithfull maiſter and inſtructours, ceaſſeth not contynuallye to inculcate and driue into the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles hartes ſuche artycles, that in all poyntes he mighte trulye and iuſtelye execute hys office. And this is the expoſition and meanynge thereof. After a little while I ſhalbe delyuered vnto the Iewes, and they ſhal condemne me, ſcourg me and at the laſt crucify me. And lykewiſe as Ionas was three dayes and three nyghtes in the belly of the whale,<note place="margin">Mat. 21</note> ſo ſhall I be three dayes, and ſo man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nyghtes alſo in the hart of the earth.

And if we deſyre to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this kingedome, and wyl ouercome ſynne, death, the diuell and hell, it is moſte conuenient &amp; neceſſarye, that we know Chriſte oure Lorde and ſauioure, oure kinge and byſſhoppe, and that by his bloode wee are reconcyled to the euerlaſtinge father.

Wherfore I great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly meruaile, what thoſe creatures think that ſo ſhar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pely and earneſtly defend our free wyl, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of our fleſhe, ſeynge that they haue bothe reade
<pb facs="tcp:9767:85"/> and heard in this texte (and ſuche other lyke) of the ignoraunce of the apoſtles. I think that they muſt haue wonderfull gloſes, to healpe theym withall. But rather I thinke that they are in lyke caſe with the apoſtles here, that they cannot tell what they ſaye, euen as S. Paule hathe written of theim, ſaiyng: Some haue erred,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1</note> and haue tourned vnto vayne iangling, willing to be doctoures of the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pture, and vnderſtande not what they ſpeake, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what they affirme.

                  <p>Thirdly, while the apoſtles vnderſtode not theſe wordes, and were in mind to axe, Chriſt preuented theim, ſaiyng: Ye demaund and enquire amongeſt you, for bicauſe I ſaide: After a while, &amp; ye ſhal not ſe me. &amp;c. Verely verely, I ſay vnto you, you ſhall wepe and lament, but the world ſhal reioyſe, and ye ſhall be ſory.

He doth not reiect or deſpiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their ignoraunce, but moſte familiarly inſtructeth them and ſheweth theim, how his wordes be to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtande, ſaiynge vnto theim, that they ſhulde be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and lament and why? bicauſe they ſhuld ſe their lord and maiſter taken of the Iues, and crucified,<note place="margin">The croſſe &amp; perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> herefore ſhal they morne and lament.

But the ioye that ſhall folowe the ſame heauines, ſhalbe euerlaſting. Take here an exaumple of this thinge. A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man when ſhe trauayleth hath ſorowe, for hyr hour is come: but when ſhee is delyuered of the childe, ſhee thinketh no more of the anguiſſhe, for ioye that a manne is borne into the worlde.

Item, All they that ſaye vnto me:<note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> Lorde, lorde, ſhall not entre into the kingedome of heauen, but they y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fulfil my fathers wyl. Likewiſe learne this, that we cannot receiue this ſpirite by oure good workes, but by the merites of Chriſt, as Chriſte ſayeth here: It is better for you that I go: for yf I go not awaye, the comforter cometh not vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to you. as thoughe he wolde ſaye:<note place="margin">Chriſte giueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſte.</note> If the infirmity of your fleſhe ſhalbe chaunged into the ſtrenthe of the faith, the holye ghoſte muſte needes bring that to paſſe in you.

But he ſetteth nothing at all for our angre. For he was ſente to rebuke, whiche alſo hee doth buſily. And bleſſed is he, that is rebuked of him, that by that meanes he may learne to knowe his ſinnes: For that done, the holi ghoſt leadeth vs further into the faith and knowledg of god, ſo that we being deliuered frome ſin, through the deſeruing and merits of Chriſt, are made the children and heires of god.</p>

Here thou heareſt, that the greateſt ſinne vnder heauen is, that wee do not beleue in Chriſt. If incredulity be the greateſt ſyn vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, then muſt it needes folow, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith is the moſt glorious &amp; higheſt thing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, which no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can deny.

But incredulity truſteth in his wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes. Wherfore what ſo euer goodnes an vnfaithful ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth outwardli, it is not accepted before god, for it cometh not of faith. For Chriſt ſaith: He that bele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth not, is all ready iudged. The worlde,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.</note> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, fleſhe, or reaſon, doth not receaue nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande this. wherefore it is needefull that the holye ghoſt come to rebuke and teache. Moreouer the holy ghoſt ſhall rebuke the world of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. How ſhall we vnderſtande that? The worlde and reaſon adſcribeth righteouſnes to oure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and both thinke and iudge, that righteouſnes cometh of mennes workes outewardelye done, as the Phariſie boaſted himſelfe to bee righteous.</p>
                  <p>But euer this chaunſeth ſo,<note place="margin">Luc. 18.</note> that they that wyll mayntaine theyre owne righteouſnes,<note place="margin">Rom. 10</note> bee not ſubiecte vnto the righteouſnes of God. Therefore
<pb facs="tcp:9767:89"/> yt is neceſſarye, that the holy ghoſte teache &amp; ſhew vs, what manner of iuſtice that is, that pleaſeth god.<note place="margin">Frome whence iuſtice cometh.</note> The iuſtice that pleaſeth god procedeth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute: that I beleue that Chriſte wente to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. that is as muche to ſaye: That I beleue that he died for me, that he roſe and aſcended vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, for to ſend me and all his elect his holy ghoſt, to open vs the filthines of our workes, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructe vs in the knowledge of god. Beholde, thus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt ſhal learn vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rightouſnes of faith. Furthermore,<note place="margin">Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the holy ghoſt ſhal rebuke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde of iudgement: for as much as they iudge not right in thinges pertaininge to righteouſnes and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Which thou ſhalte vnderſtande on this wiſe. The diuell, ſinne, deathe, hell, are conſtrained to giue place vnto Chriſte and his worde, for by hym they be ouercome. But how doth the world knowe this? Truly the world euer regardeth workes, and euer ſuffereth the diuell to blinde them, ſo that thei know not, nor yet can deuide nor ſeparate the righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouſnes of faith, from the worldes righteouſnes. And ſo remaineth Chriſt the ſtone that menne ſhall ſtumble at,<note place="margin">Luc. 2. 1 Pet. 2.</note> and a ſigne which ſhalbe ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt. For the thing which we ſhuld adſcribe vnto Chriſt, that is to ſaye, whereas we ſhulde confeſſe, that the prince of this world is iudged through Chriſt and his worde, we adſcribe yt vnto our righteouſnes. For the whych cauſe, yt is needefull that the holye ghoſt do rebuke vs, wherby we may learne to iudg right. And here haſt thou nowe the righte cauſe, why the holy ghoſte ſhall rebuke the worlde.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly here is to be noted, that Chriſt ſheweth
<pb facs="tcp:9767:89"/> vs here the infirmitie of the apoſtles, ſaying:<note place="margin">The weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtles</note> I haue yet muche to ſaye vnto you, but yee can not nowe beare it awaye. That is as muche to ſaye. Yf I ſhuld make many words with you of incredulity, of righteouſnes and of iudgement, and of my ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall kingdome, that after my reſurrection I ſhall entre into, you colde not vnderſtande it, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, for bicauſe you are yet carnall and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and my ſpirite is not as yet, confirmed in you.

Wherfore it is needefull that the holy ghoſte come. and when he cometh, he ſhall leade you into all trewthe.<note place="margin">The goſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pel is the truthe.</note> The goſpell is a doctrine of Chriſte, whole and ſounde, which doth not allo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly teache the outward honeſty, but ſheweth alſo the righteouſnes of the harte inwardly: where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it is called in the ſcripture the trewth:<note place="margin">The doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine of men bee lyes.</note> And con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary wiſe, the doctrine of men, teacheth hypocriſy, fynallye, neither vnderſtandeth nor teacheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of the righteouſnes of the hart. Wherfore this doctrine, and alſo the doctoures and teachers thereof, are called, falſe, and lyars, as yt is written in the Pſalme: Ther is no truth in the their mouth.<note place="margin">Pſal. 5.</note> that is, ther is no ſuer and certaine thing amongſt theim. And againe, thou ſhalt loſe and deſtroye all thoſe that ſpeake lies. Now ſeing that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt ſhall leade vs into all truth, and not into lyes, Let
<pb facs="tcp:9767:90"/> euery chriſtian man geſſe in his mynd, whether the fathers and the counſels haue had the holy ghoſt, whoſe ordinaunuces and lawes,<note place="margin">The cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For if they had had the holy ghoſte, they wold haue con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluded nothing againſt the worde of god. The ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ghoſt leadeth vs not into lyes, but into all truth, Howe goodlye haue they vſed this texte, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of mans traditions? Seinge the holy ghoſte teacheth none other thing, then that chriſt taught. Further, he teacheth onlye the Apoſtles, and the elect of god, to perceaue and receaue the doctrine of Chriſt: which of our ſelues we cannot vnderſtand, If they hadde eies they mighte perceaue, that the plaine texte reciteth the ſame. He ſaith: He ſhal not ſpeake of him ſelfe, but that he hath heard, he ſhall ſpeake. Item: He ſhall glorifie me, for he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue of mine and ſhew it you.

And truly, foraſmuch as in all trouble and miſery, wherwith a chriſtian man is oppreſſed, ther is no greater comfort here preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this world, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with continual &amp; daily praier, to open &amp; ſhew our neceſſity vnto god. Wherfore it is very neceſſary, that we do note &amp; print in our harts this goſpel, wherby we may be the more inflamed &amp; ſtirred to praier. Who wold reiect and deſpiſe prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as a thing not neceſſary? ſeinge that it is here in this goſpell, ſo diligently and highly commended and commaunded to vs of Chriſte? Aſke (ſaith he) and you ſhall receaue. This commaundemente of Chriſt bindeth vs aſwell, as the firſte commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in the fyrſt table of Moyſes. And this to be trewe wee maye more euidente and playne ſee, in an other place, where Chriſte ſayeth,<note place="margin">Luc. 18.</note> that wee oughte alwayes to praye, and not to bee wery. Here diligentely note, that he ſaith: we ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to praye. Therefore as we throughe a ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and ſpeciall commaundement of god are eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and entyſed to praye, ſo lykewiſe, this preſente goſpell allurethe vs therevnto throughe a greate and excellente promiſe. Here is promiſed to vs which be Chriſtian men, that oure prayer ſhall not
<pb facs="tcp:9767:91"/> be in vayne, but ſhal be ſuer to be heard. Wherfore elſe wolde he confirme and binde this promiſe with an other? Verely, verely I ſaye vnto you (ſayeth he) If you axe the father oughte in my name, hee ſhall gyue it you. alſo, Aſke and ye ſhall receaue. Here thou heareſt, that we ſhall not praye in vaine. Who wold now be ſlothfull and loth to prayer? Chriſte conſtraineth vs thorow his commaundement. And furthermore that wee ſhall not thinke to praye in vaine, he (as I ſayde before) entiſeth vs here, with a greate and high promiſe. Wherfore two thinges are heere to bee conſidered and noted. The firſte is, that we ſhall pray in none other name, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all only in Chriſts name. Then we pray in Chriſts name,<note place="margin">Chriſte is oure media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor only</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we come vnto god in the faith of Chriſt, in ſuch mind and confidence, that he all only is our mediatour, by whom all thinges be giuen vnto vs and that without him, we can deſerue nothing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrath and indignacion. Can there bee (I beſeche you) any ſainte in heauen or in earth, that prayeth for vs vnto god the father, as Chriſt doth? For by his merites and aduocacion we do not all only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine righteouſnes and remiſſion of ſinnes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo wee be made his brethren, and pertakers of hys preeſtly office, ſo that we our ſelues maye go vnto Chriſt, and call vpon him, and ſeke his helpe in all our neceſſity and nede. And that is it, that he ſaieth here: And I ſaye not vnto you, that I will pray the father for you, for the father him ſelfe loueth you, for bicauſe you haue loued me, and beleue, that I am come out from god.<note place="margin">Al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes.</note> Seinge therefore that wee haue ſuche a mediatour, yea ſeing that we our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
<pb facs="tcp:9767:91"/> are admitted, vnto this preſtly office by Chriſt, why do we not with true faithe and confidence call vpon him in oure neceſſitie? An other thinge to be noted is this. We muſt conſidre, that in no wyſe we do praye that,<note place="margin">What we ought to deſire.</note> that ſhalbe againſt the glorie &amp; wyll of god, or contrary to our ſaluacion. For it is appa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raunt, that he wyll not hear ſuch prayer, in ſo much as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pater noſter, he teacheth vs daily to praye, that his will be fulfilled. Finally, when ſo euer we praye vnto god in our vrgent neceſſities, we ſhall looke vpon the merites of Chriſt, (not vppon oure worthines) which commaundeth vs to praye, and promiſed vs to heare vs, when ſo euer we cal vpon him. For all the promiſes of god in Chriſt are ſuer, and need not to be doubted at. For S. Paule ſaith, that all the promiſes of god, ar ye, in him, and ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondaryly, it is to be noted, that foraſmuch as we are fleſhly, and know not ofte times what we haue neede of (as S. Paule ſaith to the Romanes) Chriſte voutchſaueth here to learne vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> what oure prayer ſhuld be. And as he himſelfe faith: we ought to praye, that our ioye maye be perfect. But what manner of ioye is this? Truly it ſhall neuer be tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poral nor wordly, but ſpirituall. Of the which,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> S. Paule writeth, ſaying: Reioyſe in the lorde alwaies and againe I ſay, reioyſe. But whence cometh this reioyſinge? Of faith. And how is that broughte to paſſe? That is brought to paſſe, when I heare the goſpel preached, in the which remiſſion of ſinnes is geuen to all mortall creatures, by Chriſt. Whiche preaching, yf I wyll haue it profitable and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vnto me, I muſt needs beleue it, which thing, I

                  <p>HEre is commended in this goſpel vnto vs, the greate diligence which Chriſt tooke in the office of preaching. And alſo the great deſire that the people had, that folowed him, to hear the worde of god.

When Chriſt ſaw now the greedy deſire of the people to hear y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of god, &amp; that the people preaced ſo on him, he went in to a ſhip that was Simons, (for he ſtode by the lake of Genezareth) and taught the people out of the ſhip.

For what profiteth, if the preacher preache and teache per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuallye, if there dothe no man heare him or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue his worde? For it is aſwell commaunded the to heare,<note place="margin">Luc. 11.</note> as the preacher to teache. For yf they bee pronounced bleſſed, that hear the word of god and kepe it, ſo muſte it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently folowe, that they be damned, that do not heare it and kepe it.

<pb facs="tcp:9767:115"/> and geue you that you lacke, but euerye manne ſhall do the thinge that he is called vnto, that is, they ſhall laboure. Gene. 3.

And this conſidereth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaiynge: Maiſter, wee haue laboured all the night, and gatte nothinge, but at thy word, I will loſe forthe the nette. Whoe dothe not perceiue in theſe wordes of Peter, that all oure counſailes, thoughtes, and all oure merites, what ſo euer wee intende for to dooe or leaue, are all in vaine, and to none effecte, excepte that they be taken in hande, and begonne in the name of god?

For loke to whome it pleaſeth the lorde, he geueth yt in ſleepe. But when Chriſte ſaide: Lette ſlyppe your nettes, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples regarded not their owne labour, but hauing reſpecte to the worde of Chriſte, then tooke they a greate multitude, in ſo muche that they were fayne to call to their felows (which were in an other ſhip) for helpe, and filled bothe the ſhippes full.<note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> Whoe wolde not nowe beleue Chriſte, whiche not all only wyll, but can helpe vs Therfore beleue nowe, and he will ſee that thou ſhalte lacke nothinge, nother for body nor ſowle.

The righteouſnes of works is, when I in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tende and go aboute to do workes withoute fayth in Chriſt, thinking that by ſuche outward workes, the law is fulfilled. And ſuche righteouſnes did the Iewes vſe for the moſte party, and in eſpeciall the ſcribes and phariſeis. For the fleſh, wherin is graft hipocriſye, is ſo affectioned and of ſuche nature,
<pb facs="tcp:9767:118"/> that nothinge can pleaſe yt ſo excellentlye, as the outward ſhine of workes, and it canne haue none other iudgemente herein, then that ſuche workes are acceptable before god, and that the ſame are re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warded with euerlaſting life. Hereof commeth this damnable and deteſtable truſte in workes, with the whiche the holye prophetes haue ſo warred and foughten:<note place="margin">Eſai. 1. and. 19</note> and eſpeciall Eſaias, complaininge on the Iewes, bicauſe that they did worſhippe the works of their owne handes. And in an other place he ſaith: This people draweth nigh me with their mouth, and praiſeth me highely with their lyppes, where as their harte neuertheles is farre frome me. But how doth Chriſt lyke this righteouſnes? Tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly he thruſteth it into the deep pit of hell, in ſo much that hee denieth his diſciples the entringe into the kingedome of heauen, excepte theyr righteouſnes excede the rightouſnes of the ſcribes and phariſes. How could this rightouſnes of the Iewes be more contemptuouſly depreſſed? If our ſpiritual men in tyme paſte, and ſo likewiſe nowe a dayes, were, and had beene ſo iudged and condemned vnto hell for their hypocriſy, good lord, I thinke for very pure angre, they wolde ſpewe out tier. But the ſpirite of Chriſte which is ſent to rebuke the world of this in credulity, ſetteth little by their threatnynges, and angre.<note place="margin">Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of fayth.</note> The righteouſnes of faith is, when I hope and truſte in Chriſt, and not in workes, but in ſuch wiſe, that I open and declare my ſelfe in the meane<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>while to haue this truſte and confidence, throughe fulfilling of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes &amp; good workes.

For it is the ſame good ſeede, that fel in the good ground, &amp; brought forth muche frute. Againe contrary wiſe, the oute<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde righteouſnes, as a worke of the fleſhe, may be done without the righteouſnes of faythe, as we ſee in the phariſeis,<note place="margin">Mat. 24</note> whiche be likened vnto painted ſepulchres, that apeare beutyfull outward, &amp; with in are full of deade mens bones and filthines. But thou wilte ſay vnto me: Doth not Chriſte himſelfe here call the righteouſnes of the phariſeis, a righte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ouſnes?

<pb facs="tcp:9767:119"/> haue harde (ſaith he) how it was ſaide to theim of olde tyme: Thou ſhalte not kill, for whoſoeuer kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, ſhalbe in daunger of iudgement. But I ſaye vnto you: Whoſoeuer is angry with his brother, is in daunger of iudgement. &amp;c. Likewiſe alſo Saint Paule ſaith:<note place="margin">Rom. 7</note> The law is ſpirituall that is, the lawe cannot be fulfilled, excepte the ſpirite, faith and the harte, be ioyned with the outwarde workes, ſeynge that the lawe requireth not allonly the outward fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhion, but alſo the affection of the harte. Therfore Chriſte in this commaunde mente that pertayneth to man ſlaughter, maketh foure degrees, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee counteth giltye, not allonly thoſe, that kyll and ſlaye with the ſwearde, but alſo all them, that with thought and worde ſinne againſt their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure.<note place="margin">Anger.</note> The firſte degree is the anger of the harte, which Chriſte doth lyken vnto the outwarde worke of man ſlaughter. And foraſmuche as this angre is grafte in euery one of vs, no man canne kepe this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement and precept, except he be new borne againe through the ſpirit. The ſecond degre is, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,<note place="margin">Racha.</note> by which worde is ſignified, tokens of wrathe and hatred: that is, when I beholde my brother wyth a lowrynge and a grimme countinaunce, or paſſynge by, do diſdaine to ſpeake familiarlye vnto him. And thoſe outwarde miſfaſhioned manners dooe condemne euen as muche as the deede it ſelfe. The thirde degree is, if I call my brother; Foole:<note place="margin">Foole.</note> By whiche worde is ſignified and vnderſtande all manner of opprobrious and ignominious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and thoſe wordes yf they come oute of ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coure and malyce, they condempne me as well
<pb facs="tcp:9767:119"/> as man ſlaughter. But it is poſſible alſo, that ſuch iniurious wordes, ofte times procede of a faithful hart, as we ſee that the phariſe is were called fooles often tymes of Chriſte,<note place="margin">Mat 14 Manne ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and that is nother hurtefull nor damnable. The fourth degre is man ſlaughter, euen committed with the deede, that is, when I not being contente with mine iniurious and opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words, and ſtraunge vncorteous countenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but go farther to handſtrokes, &amp; with my hande (as did Cain) I kil my neighbour againſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente and precepte of god.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> Nowe for as muche as god in his preceptes doth not allonly forbid the outeward vngracious workes, but alſo the inward miſchiefe and affection of the harte, howe is it then poſſible, that the outewarde righteouſnes can ſaue and iuſtifye? Surely hereto pertayneth the ſaying of S. Ioh. He that hateth hys brother,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5</note> is a murthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rer. that is, It is not ſufficient that thou haſte not killed thy brother with thy hande, but thou muſte haue a louinge and gentle harte towarde all men, not to dooe and wiſhe well allonlye to thy friendes, but alſo to thine enemyes. Finallye. If I deſire to be ſaued, ſo it is needefull that I be iuſte &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous, both inwardely and outwardely, or elſe oute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde righteouſneſſe profyteth the nothynge at all.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdely, Chriſt exhorteth &amp; allureth vs here in this goſpel to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of oure neighbour, foraſmuch as he hath referred this precepte, (Thou ſhalt not kyll) to the loue of oure brother, and that two man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner of wayes. Firſte, for as muche as hee teacheth that no worke (how good or precious ſo euer it be)
<pb facs="tcp:9767:120"/> canne pleaſe God, excepte that thou do firſte deſire thy brother, whome thou haſte offended, to pardon and forgiue the. Therefore he maketh mention of all oblation commaunded of God in the olde lawe, which is nowe abrogated, and was then a hyghe excellente worke. This is the meaning of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Chriſte. If you dooe obſerue with neuer ſo greate diligence, all goddes ſeruice, whiche hereto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore hath beene commaunded you through Moiſes which nowe after my death ſhall ceaſe and take no more effecte, yet in that ſhall ye not pleaſe god, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte you be reconciled to your brother, whome you haue offended. For it is not ſeruinge of god, when thou offendeſt thy neighboure, but that is called ſeruyng of god, when thou offendeſt not thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boure. For that that, thou doeſt with hinderaunce of thy brother, cannot pleaſe god. Therefore God through the prophete Oſeas ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Oſee. 6.</note> ſayinge: I will haue mercy, and not ſacrifice. Truly, oblacion was commaunded in the lawe by god, yet did he not ſet by yt, yf thou diddeſt offende thy neighbour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte he that had offended his brother, did fyrſte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concyle himſelfe. And as Chriſte ſpeaketh of obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion vnto the Iewes, as vnto thoſe whiche as yet were vnder the lawe, ſo likewiſe, goddes ſeruyce in the newe teſtament, is to no purpoſe, except thou be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled to thy brother, whom thou haſt offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, Chriſte warneth vs here to agree with our aduerſary, quickly, while we are in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way with him. &amp;c. That is, if any man offend the, and he that hath offended the, deſireth the to pardon him, forgiue him gladly, as Chriſt did, ſaiyng: Father for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giue
<pb facs="tcp:9767:120"/> them, for they knowe not what they do. And if you be not deſired therunto, yet be alwaies readye to forgiue, or elſe thy conſcience in the day of iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente ſhall accuſe the, and ſo thou ſhalt be caſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon.<note place="margin">Luc. 24</note> Verely I ſay vnto you (ſaith Chriſt) thou ſhalt not come out thence, tyll thou haue payed the vttermoſt farthing, that is, Thou ſhalt neuer come out. For this word, vntil, ſo ſignifieth in this place. Therfore let euery chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well conſidre &amp; take heede, that he be founde in brotherly loue, ſo that his workes, whiche he ſerueth god withall, may be acceptable and pleaſaunte before god, throughe Chriſt our ſauiour.

As thoughe he wolde ſaye: Howe poſſible it is to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grapes of thornes, or figges of thyſtles, ſo poſſible it is, that a falſe prophete, in whome the knowledge of god is not, ſhulde teache anye good thynge, thoughe hee neuer ſo muche gloryfye hym ſelfe in the knowledge of the worde of god. A falſe prophete maye boaſte and gloryfye him ſelfe of the goſpell, but the trewe doctrine of the faith, he ſhal neuer attayne nor folow. All that they haue taught with theyr vaine ianglinge, are but leaues, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne leaues, hauinge only an outeward ſhining. And for to knowe theſe falſe prophetes, and theyr ſpirite, It is needefull to haue the holye ſpirit and perfecte knoweledge of God. Wherefore wee chriſtian menne, whyche in this daungerous tyme are aſſaulted with thys peſtiferous and ſtraunge learnyng, muſt ſo indeuoure our ſelues,<note place="margin">Faythe charity.</note> that fayth and charity, wherin conſiſteth the hole ſumme and foundacion of oure doctrine, maye euer bee oure rule, whereby we maye diſcerne and iudge all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doctrine, that ſhall bee layde before vs. For faythe cleaueth allonlye to the worde of god, and ſayeth wyth Saincte Paule. I knowe
<pb facs="tcp:9767:123"/> nothinge but Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1</note> and hym crucified. that is, I ſeeke remiſſion of ſinnes, righteouſnes and ſaluacion allonlye in the paſſion and merytes of Chriſte. And charitie, with the deede and worke, witneſſeth ſuche fayth to be in the harte. And what ſo euer is contrarye to this doctrine of faythe and charitie, commeth of the diuell, thoughe they that teache ſo, in their ſo teachinge, leade neuer ſo rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious a lyfe. For the tree is euell, and ſo likewiſe is the frute euell: Shall we iudge nowe ſome trees by theyr frutes? The papiſtes haue a longe ſeaſon had the handlyng and adminiſtracion of the worde of god and the ſacramentes,<note place="margin">The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes.</note> with ſo great ſhyne of holines outwardli, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thei haue nigh ſubiected vnto them the whole world.

                  <p>Now we haue the word of god, which we ſet againſt their doctrine, concerning works, and we find their learning to ſtriue &amp; be repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the manifeſt worde of god, and to bringe nothinge to paſſe, but hipocriſy. Therfore according to their frutes, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue and abiect the whole papaſie with all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto it, yea if the diuel rage neuer ſo much: We reproue &amp; deteſt alſo thoſe ſpriteful me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their Maſſes &amp; ſuꝑſticion haue abuſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupper inſtituted by Chriſt, contrary to the manifeſt words of Chriſte. Yea, we reproue theim for the fruicte of their doctrine: For beſides the falſe expoundinge &amp; laiyng out of Chriſtes wordes, they haue brought the ſacramentes into greate abuſion. What ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:9767:123"/> I ſaye of the anabaptiſtes? I wolde to god the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious frute of their doctrine were not ſo many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.

                  <p>Thirdelye, Chriſte expoundeth theſe wordes (by theyr frutes ye ſhall knowe theim) euen as he wold haue theim vnderſtanded, making a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene hipocrites and thoſe that fulfill his fathers will, and declareth both their rewardes. The iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers and glorifiers in workes crye euer, Lord, Lord and that more is, they glorifie in the goſpell, and in the holy ghoſte. yea and are ſo bold, that they dare ſaye: Lorde haue wee not prophecied in thy name: haue we not caſte out diuels in thy name? &amp;c. But it is but hypocriſye, &amp; remaineth hypocriſye, for the whiche they haue no rewarde. For Chriſte ſayeth: Depart from me, ye workers of iniquitie, I knowe you not. And fayth in this preſent goſpell: Euerye tree that bringeth not forth good frute, ſhalbe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen downe, and caſte in to the fier.

For we haue taughte hitherto, that allonly throughe faythe we be iuſtified and ſaued, ſhall the workes do it nowe? No, not ſo: The wordes ſounde as thoughe it ſhulde ſeeme ſo, but well expounded and vnderſtande, they pull nothing frome faythe. Chriſte ſpeaketh here of good frutes, and wyll not that the tree that beareth thoſe good frutes, ſhulde be reproued and caſte awaye. For how wolde you haue good frutes, yf there were not fyrſte a good tree? And howe wolde you haue frute, yf the tree didde not beare it, and bring it forth? Therfore it is neceſſarye, that the tree be good, before it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth good frute.<note place="margin">What good workes do pleeſe God.</note> And ſo likewiſe we ſpeake of good workes: No worke, how precious or excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſo euer yt bee, can be acceptable or pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before god, except the perſon which doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke, be firſt iuſtified &amp; acceptable before god. If thou wilte be iuſte and acceptable, thou muſt beleue. And yf thou beleueſt, then arte thou iuſtified.

And therefore when the perſon is accepted &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:9767:126"/> iuſtified before god, then likewiſe are the works ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cepted, not that the works be of them ſelues of ſuch reputacion and worthines, but forbicauſe they bee wrought of that perſone, that is iuſtified and ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cepted before god. Wherfore whan Chriſte doth ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moniſhe vs, for to make vs frendes of the wicked Mammon, and to do good works, doth not regard ſo muche the worke, as he doth the fountaine, from whens the worke floweth.

Thoſe workes, which the Iewes did obſerue in the law, which alſo were commaunded of god himſelfe, did not pleaſe god when they were done without faith, much leſſe ſhall thoſe workes pleaſe god, whiche be inuented &amp; made of men. Although Chriſte ſaide: Make you frendes of the wicked Mammon, teaching vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the workes of charity, yet doth he not adſcribe righteouſnes to the ſame, but he wyl that our faith be declared by them, and brought to lyght, for it is needefull that the tree be knowen by the frutes.<note place="margin">Faythe is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen by workes</note> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſidre alſo, that Chriſte in theſe wordes (Make you friendes of the wicked Mammon) did loke vpon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> workes of charity, namely that then our goodes ar good &amp; right, when they be tourned and diſtributed to the vſe and helpe of the poore and needy: and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary wiſe, they are naught &amp; wicked, when we ſeke in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only our pleaſure and voluptuouſnes.

And in an other place he ſayth: Be of good comforte, I haue ouercome the world. that is,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16</note> Through me ye ſhall nat allonly ouercome the worlde, and that that is in it, but alſo ye ſhal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome death, the diuell and hel.

                  <p>Secondarily, in this goſpel Chriſt doth morne &amp; weepe for the Iewes, bicauſe they knewe not what was for their peace, wherwith he declared &amp; ſhewed vnto vs, the blindenes and wickednes of the fleſh. Wherof (I beſeche you) can a man glorify, ſeing ſo many excellent ſermones, ſo many and great myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles done by Chriſt at Ieruſalem, and thoſe in a ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner all done in vaine? Where is here free wil with his power, whiche the prudente and wiſe men of this worlde, hathe attributed vnto yt? Wherefore wolde not they beleue his worde, and knowe him to be the ſonne of god, and the trewe Meſſias? Sure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly it was hidden frome their eies, though notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge, they did both hear his wordes, and ſawe his miracles. Wherout it foloweth, that our fleſhe while it is not lightened with the holy ghoſt, and a newe harte giuen vnto it,<note place="margin">Eze. 36.</note> is very blind, indurate, and wicked, whiche canne in no wiſe know god in Chriſt.<note place="margin">The bli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſhe.

                  <p>Thyrdely, here is declared vnto the Iewes, the rewarde and puniſhemente of their blindenes and infidelitie.<note place="margin">The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitye.</note> For thy enemies (ſaieth he) ſhall caſte vp a banke about the and thy children, and ſhal not leaue in the, one ſtone vpon an other, bicauſe thou haſte not knowen the tyme, wherein thou haſt been viſited.

Therefore lette euerye manne tourne frome his wicked waye, and beleue the goſpell, leſte wee periſhe both body and ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Fourthlye, Chriſte commendeth in this goſpell his office, in that, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next day folowyng he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into the temple, &amp; droue out the byers &amp; ſellers, ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">Eſa. 56.</note> It is written, My houſe is a houſe of prayer, and ye haue made it a denne of murtherers.

For why may not Chriſt, in ſo much as he ys lord both of the bodely temple &amp; ſpirituall alſo, driue out ſuche villains? Now, that Chriſte did here with the handes and with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that maye we not do, but all only with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and worde of god.

                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des.</note> The lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge of handes vppon, was a cuſtome vſed in the olde Teſtament, and remained likewiſe by Chriſt and his apoſtelles, in ſo muche that often tymes, when they healed the diſeaſed, or wolde giue the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ghoſte,<note place="margin">Luc. 4.</note> the layed their handes vpon them: as we reade in the fourth chapiter of Luc. that Chriſte lai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed his handes vppon thoſe that were ſycke,<note place="margin">Act. 14. and .8.</note> and hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led theim. And alſo in the actes of the apoſtels is
<pb facs="tcp:9767:133"/> written: They laide their handes vppon them, and thei receaued the holy ghoſt. So theſe men bicauſe they hadde ofte ſeene Chriſte laye his handes vpon thoſe that he healed, they prayed him likewiſe, that he woulde voucheſafe to laye his hande vpon this deafe man. Here note that theſe men had true faith and confidence in Chriſte. For if they had not had faythe, why woulde they haue brought that poore man vnto Chriſte? or why would they haue pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, to heale this manne? For to brynge the ſicke impotent menne vnto Chriſte, and not beleue that he could heale theim, were not called, ſeekinge of Chriſte, but rather a mockinge of Chriſte. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly they had a very true faith, and did know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge Chriſte to be the ſauiour bothe of bodye and ſoule. And that thou mayſt eaſyly perceiue, in that, they praying vnto Chriſte, obtained their peticion, and throughe their prayer and meanes, the deafe was reſtored vnto health. Further thou ſhalt note, that this deafe is come to faithe and health, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough an other mannes faithe, but not thereby iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſaued. For to iuſtificacion and ſaluaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euery manne muſte haue his owne faithe. An other mannes faithe maye praye for me, that God through Chriſte wyll make me faithfull, but to get remiſſion of ſinnes, I my ſelfe muſte beleue and haue a perfecte faithe. For it is written: He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth in me, (he ſaithe not he,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> that truſteth in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans faith) hath euerlaſting lyfe.</p>

And ſo in likewiſe how the prayer of all thoſe that pray vnto the father in his name, ſhalbe hearde. But what did he, whan he toke hym aſyde from the people?

                  <p>Thirdly, we find here an excellent frute of faith, in thoſe that out of this miracle acknowledged and confeſſed Chriſt to be their ſauiour. For thei ſaide: He hathe doone all thinge well:<note place="margin">The praiſe of Chriſte.</note> The deafe hath he made to heare, and the dumme to ſpeake. Thinkeſt thou not this to bee an hyghe prayſe of Chriſte? They ſaye: Hee hathe doone all thynges welle. Of whome vnder heauen myghte thys bee ſayed? Oure fyrſte father Adame ſo behaued himſelfe in Paradyſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> that throughe his diſobedience, deathe and damnacion entred into the worlde.

Hereby we are reconciled vnto the father, and of deafe men be made to heare, and of dumme men and ſpechles haue obtained our ſpeache.

And though he of preſumption &amp; pryde, which euer doth folowe hipocriſy, enquired no more of that thinge that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moned of, yet muſt not we leaue ther, but are bounde to knowe what is the lawe and what it worketh, and what the goſpell is, and what it brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth to paſſe.

In thend of this ſimilitude this ſcribe know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledgeth himſelfe, that he was neighbour vnto hym that fell amongeſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murtherers, which holy hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was wounded, and had compaſſion vpon him, wher Chriſt teacheth vs, not only who is my neighbour, namely he that needeth of my helpe, whether he be frend or fo, but alſo mihtely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this ſcribe had not kept this ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement in louing his neighbour, wherout it muſt needs folow &amp; was euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that he had not obſerued the firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wherin he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to loue god. For why elſe wold Chriſt haue ſayd: Go thy way then and do thou likewiſe? If he had done it, there had bene no nede of a commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to haue done yt againe. Wherefore in concluſion. Though this ſcribe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardely appeared neuer ſo vertuous &amp; iuſte, yet is
<pb facs="tcp:9767:138"/> he here ouercome, that he neither kept the fyrſte nor the ſecond commaundement. Wherfore let vs take here an example, not of the ſcribe, but of the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, whom the loue of god ſo allured to do this be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefyte vpon him that was wounded. But note this alſo, how priuily he toucheth this ſcribe, in ſpeaki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of the Prieſt and of the Leuite, that paſſed by thys wounded man, without ſhewing of any mercy vnto him. For therwith all, Chriſte accuſeth al the prieſtꝭ at Ieruſalem, that they had neither the loue of god nor of their neighbour, without there chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by ſome profite.

                  <p>FYrſte, this goſpell declareth vnto vs mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous excellent examples of fayth in theſe leepers, whiche togither with one voice cry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed and called vpon Chriſte for helpe. And theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are meruailouſlye well ioyned to that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that Chriſte taughte before, teaching vs (as S. Luc. teſtifieth) to ſaye and confeſſe:<note place="margin">Luc. 17</note> We be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſeruauntes, yea though we do all that is commaunded vs to do. Out of which wordes wee maye gather, that ſeying there is no worke ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before god without fayth, that there is no worke at all, wherby we can get or obtaine any thing of god, in eſpecyall yf it pertayne vnto ſaluacion. For that that he gyueth, he gyueth of hys mere mercy, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore if we will obtayne any thinge of hym, we muſt gape after mercy. For yf we regard our workes and haue confidence in theym, yt ys vnpoſſyble but wee ſhall doubte, whether he wyll helpe vs or not, for as muche as no mortall manne doeth ſo muche as hee ys bounde to dooe. Is yt not blaſphemye to god contrarye and repugnaunte to the fayth in Chryſt, to doubte, whether wee be hearde or not? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee maye ſee in theſe tenne lepoures, that they beleued and doubted not, but that freely wythout anye deſeruynge, Chryſt wold reſtore them to helth. Whych yf they had doubted, ſurely they wolde not baue haſted vnto Chryſt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo great deſier, neyther wolde haue cryed oute ſo loude before they came at hym. But thys ys the matter: They had herd how meeke and mercifull Chriſt was, and that he merci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully
<pb facs="tcp:9767:139"/> helpt euery manne, that deſired helpe of him. Through ſuche fame and ſpeakyng of Chriſt, they conceiued a certain hope &amp; truſt to be reſtored vnto helth. And ſo was it brought to paſſe.<note place="margin">When Chriſt is found through fayth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> menne ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſtyll and ſeke none other.</note> And whan as he entred into a certaine toune, there mette him ten Leperous men, whiche ſtode ſtyll for ioy accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the nature and diſpoſicion of fayth. They ſtoode, as though they would ſaye: Here is he that can helpe vs, and wyll helpe vs, what wyll wee go any further? Let vs open oure infirmitie to this mercyfull Lord, and ſuerly he wyll not ſuffre vs to go away without comfort.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> And after foloweth their peticion, whiche was not done priuely, but with a loud voyce, wherout we may note, howe they hoped for great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of Chriſt. But what ſay they? Ieſu maiſter, haue mercy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. Howe could they haue made ſuche an excellent prayer, if they had not been inſtructed by the holy ghoſt? For to acknowledge Chriſt to be their gouernour and maiſter, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that he was ſent from God, and his doctrin to be ſuche, as is worthy to be receyued of all menne. And to deſire of him to ſhewe his mercy vpon vs, is nothyng els, but to confeſſe that wee of oure owne righteouſneſſe, goodnes and woorkes, can obtaine nothyng, but muſt receiue al thyng through grace. Wee geue vnto God his owne honour, when wee knowlege him true in his ſaiyng, where he ſayth: Without me ye can do nothyng.<note place="margin">Iho. 15.</note> Nowe foraſmuch as theſe Lepres haue ſo great hope and truſt in the goodnes of Chriſt, and doubt nothyng, but that he wyll helpe them, We muſt nedes confeſſe, that thei had a true fayth. Wherfore let vs here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, that
<pb facs="tcp:9767:140"/> we learne likewyſe to ſeke and call vpon Chriſte in our trouble and neceſſitie.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, we ſee in this Goſpel, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if we ſeke Chriſt with a true fayth, he wyll ſhewe him ſelfe as good and mercyfull towarde vs, as he hath done towarde theſe Lepres. Fyrſt he beholdeth them. Bleſſed are we if Chriſt with his mercyfull eyen lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon vs,<note place="margin">Chriſt ſhewed himſelfe vnto vs</note> &amp; fyndeth fayth in our heartes. For where that chaunſeth, we be ſure to haue ſaluacion, both of body and ſoule. And that the beholdyng of Chriſt ſignified no wrathe, but grace, the woordes that folowe declare it, for he ſayth: Go your wayes, and ſhewe your ſelues vnto the prieſtes. For vnto thoſe were geuen power by the law,<note place="margin">Leui. 13</note> to diſcerne and loke vpon Leepres. Nowe when Chriſte perceiued the fayth of theſe Lepres, he ſayth not that he wyll helpe them, but as though they were alredy holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he biddeth them to go and ſhewe them ſelues to the prieſtes, whoſe office and duetie was to iudge and diſcerne Lepre. What do nowe theſe Lepres? They do euen as Abraham did,<note place="margin">Gen. 12</note> whan God commaunded him to go out of his countrey and from his kynred and from his fathers houſe, he aſked not where hee ſhould become, but obayed vnto God, and in his ſo goyng, conceiued a ſure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence, that God would not lede him amyſſe. And in likewyſe do theſe ten Leepres. They beleued that this woorde of Chriſt (Go your wayes) was not ſpoken in vayne, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly would bring them their health, as it did. For thus ſayth the text: As they went, it came to paſſe that they were clenſed. Who would not nowe hope I truſt in the goodnes of Chriſt? whiche heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
<pb facs="tcp:9767:140"/> ſo willyngly, ſo louyngly &amp; ſo gladly, ſo that for his benignitee, familiaritee and mercy ſake, all the whole worlde is bound to haſt vnto him, to aſke mercy. But we, alas,<note place="margin">The worlde is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</note> are ſo vngratious &amp; indurate that no beneuolence or gratiouſnes (although it be neuer ſo great) can moue vs to ſeeke Chriſt. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſayd in a certaine place: If you had fayth like a grayne of Muſtardſede,<note place="margin">Luc. 17 Mat. 17</note> and ſhould ſay vnto this Mulbery tree: Plucke thy ſelfe vp by the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and plant thy ſelf in the ſea, it ſhould obey you. As though he would ſay: In you ſhalbe the fault, and not in me. If you can beleue, my helpe ſhal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be at hande. But let euery Chriſtian manne learne hereout, howe he ſhould behaue himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde Chriſte oure Lorde, and ſo he nedeth not to care.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdly, we ſee in this goſpel the geuyng of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes of this Samaritane, which when he perceiued himſelfe to be cleane, he returned againe, and with a loude voyce magnifyed God, geuyng him than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes for the great benefite done vnto him. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine wee ſee here the ingratitude and vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the other nyne, whiche fell from their fayth, and gaue no thankes to Chriſt for the great benefite done vnto them. Wherout we learne,<note place="margin">Mat. 20</note> that there be many called to the fayth, &amp; but fewe which perſeuer therin vnto the ende. It is a meruailous thynge and wonderfull to ſay, that theſe ten menne had fayth, and therby obtayned helth, and yet was there but one of them that perſeuered therein, and was ſaued. Who would not nowe feare him ſelfe, and ſtande in dreade, to ſee theſe nyne Iewes that
<pb facs="tcp:9767:141"/> firſt beleued,<note place="margin">Mat. 10 and. 14.</note> and ſo ſhamefully fell againe from it. This is a true ſaiyng, where Chriſt ſayth: Whoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer perſeuereth vnto thende, ſhalbe ſaued. There are many of vs, which heare the worde of God, and receiue it with ioye, and ſhewe theim ſelues as though they would deuour the whole Goſpell, and yet for all that, in the ende they do not alonely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their fayth, but alſo againſt their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<note place="margin">Gala. 5.</note> they do perſecute the manyfeſt trueth. Vnto whom might very well bee ſpoken: Ye ranne well, who was a let vnto you, that you ſhould not obaye the truth?<note place="margin">Mat. 10</note> Briefely: Chriſt is true in that he hath ſpoken, ſaiyng: There be many called, but there be but fewe choſen. Wherfore by right the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and vnthankefulnes of theſe nyne Iewes, ought to feare vs, and not only to feare vs, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to conſtraine vs dayly and hourely to pray vnto God, that we may obtayne through Chriſt this con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtancie and perſeuerance. Alſo the thankefulnes of the Samaritane, may prouoke vs to laude &amp; praiſe God for his goodnes, that we receiue of him. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuche as our mercyfull God meruaylouſly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in rendryng and geuyng ſuche thankes, as he ſpeaketh through the Prophete Dauid:<note place="margin">Pſa. 49</note> Who ſo offereth vnto me thankes and praiſe, he honoureth me. Why (I pray you) doth Chriſt aſke after theſe nyne that were cleane, and doth not returne again vnto him, to geue him thankes? Truely therfore, that their ingratitude and vnthankefulnes highly diſpleaſed him. And wherfore thynke you doth the Euangeliſt ſo diligently diſcribe, that this Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane, whiche criyng out, did fall doune vpon his
<pb facs="tcp:9767:141"/> face at Ieſus feete, and magnifyed God, and gaue him thankes? doubteles that hee therwith woulde commend, publiſhe and ſhewe vs the conſtancy of his faith, and how highely the ſacrifice of giuinge thankes and praiſe, pleaſeth god. Nowe foraſmuch as the kingdome of god is taken from the vnthank<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful Iewes, and giuen vnto vs Gentiles, we know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging this benefite, let vs daily giue thankes vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to God throughe Chriſte, that hee will vouchſafe to make vs conſtant in faith, and bring vs to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſaluacion, through Chriſte our lord.

This benefite done to this wydowe, is and may be to vs a lyuely doctrine, that we ſhall hope for all goodnes of Chriſt, if that vngratious infidelite did not hynder vs, and leade vs awaye from the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Chriſt.<note place="margin">The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth teache &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth fayth.</note> Suche examples of the great loue and charite of Chriſt, do leade &amp; inſtruct vs to true fayth, ſo that we may perceiue that we be not onely reſtored vnto health by grace, but alſo thereby are iuſtified and ſaued.

<pb facs="tcp:9767:146"/> that praye to him for it? Briefly. At all tymes he is ready to helpe vs and to do vs good, ſo that we can beleue &amp; doubte not. And for the moſte partie, then doth he helpeth vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue moſt neede of him, yea, when we thinke that God himſelfe, heauen and yearth, &amp; all is againſt vs, &amp; that we be vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, then (I ſay) doth he begyn to helpe. And the ſame thou ſeeſt to happen to this woman. For when her ſorowe was greateſt, then did he helpe her. And that is the ſame that Dauid ſayth: When I call,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.</note> heare me, O God of my righteouſnes, and comforte me in my trouble.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdly, we ſee in this miracle the ſtrength and vertue of Gods woorde,<note place="margin">The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and vertu of the word of God.</note> and what it worketh in vs when we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend it by fayth. For the Euangeliſt after that he hath ſhewed &amp; declared vnto vs, howe Chriſt had pitie on this woman and comforted her, after he wryteth, howe Chriſt through his woorde, rayſed this child fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, &amp; ſayth: He came nigh &amp; touched the coffyn, &amp; they that bare him ſtode ſtil, &amp; he ſayd: Yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I ſay vnto thee, aryſe.

But what happened? The dead ſat vp and bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to ſpeake. Beholde the great vertue of Chriſtes worde, that by the ſame the dead are raiſed to life. And whatſoeuer is done here, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hiſtory to this yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the ſame muſt be done dayly, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in vs. For who is without ſynne? And the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of ſynne is death. Therfore if we wyll be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſynne, &amp; eſcape euerlaſtyng death, Chriſt with his worde muſt come &amp; do it. For Chriſt ſayth:
<pb facs="tcp:9767:147"/> He that kepeth my worde,<note place="margin">Ihon. 8.</note> ſhal not dye euerlaſtyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And his worde muſt bee comprehended &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded by a true fayth. For where the knowlege of this worde lacketh,<note place="margin">Ihon. 1.</note> there Chriſt which is the word, is not knowen. And againe, where Chriſt is not knowen, there cannot God be praiſed nor glorified with the woordes of this people, ſaiyng: A great prophet is riſen amongſt vs, and God hath viſited his people.<note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of God bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geuyng.</note> And contrary wiſe, where this worde is comprehended &amp; in heart conceyued, there is Chriſt knowen, &amp; when he is knowen, then is God praiſed and glorifyed, becauſe that he hath viſited vs, not in his wrath, but with his infinite mercy, and hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs his only welbeloued ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, ſo that through his paſſion &amp; death, he hath redemed vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſynne, death, deuil, and hell, For the whiche great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite we are bounde to thanke him euerlaſtyngly.</p>

Fyrſt he was in hand with theſe Phariſies, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would haue gladly inſtructed, howe all lawes in tyme of neede are bounde to geue place vnto loue and charitee, but they would neither heare, not yet receyue his doctrine, their heartes were ſtricken with ſo great blyndes. Yea, they would not onely refuſe to heare Chriſte, but ſought alwayes &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to diſtroy him, whiche thyng happened chiefly
<pb facs="tcp:9767:149"/> vpon the Sabboth daye,<note place="margin">Deu 18. Mar. 3.</note> when in the ſynagoge he made whole the mans hand that was drye and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. Neuertheleſſe Chriſt is frendly to this man that had the dropſy, he healeth him, &amp; byddeth him go his waies. Howbeit, it is to be thought that this man that had the dropſye had a good hope &amp; truſt in Chriſt, inſomuch that he folowed Chriſt into the Phariſeis houſe. And without doubt he had not been healed, if he had not had ſuche an hope in Chriſte. And as the blyndnes of theſe Phariſeis ought to abaſhe and feare vs, becauſe that thei had eyen and ſawe not, eares and heard not, an heart &amp; beleued not, ſo the goodnes &amp; benignite of Chriſte, ſhewed vnto this man that had the dropſy, ought to moue vs to lift vp our heartes, and to put al our truſt and confidence in Chriſt. Therfore this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and ſuche like,<note place="margin">Rom. 25</note> are written vnto vs, that therout we may learne, what maner a man Chriſt is, &amp; why the father hath ſent him into this worlde, and what from him is to be hoped for of a chriſten ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He did good vnto this man that had the dropſye, becauſe he hoped well in him. Wherfore then ſhould he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vs any good thyng, if we beleue in him? Is his hand ſhortened,<note place="margin">Eſai. 59</note> that it can not helpe? No truely.</p>
                  <p>His mercy endureth for euer. The faute is in vs, &amp; not in his helpyng hand, &amp; that forbecauſe we wyll neither acknowlege our infirmite, nor yet beleue. But if we wyl acknowlege our imbecilite &amp; weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſpecially in thoſe thinges that partayne to our ſoule, and aſke grace of Chriſt in a true fayth, it is not poſſible, but it ſhall be graunted vs. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, it is requiſite, that we once obtaynyng this
<pb facs="tcp:9767:149"/> his grace and mercy, endeuour our ſelues to ſhewe lyke loue and charity to our neighbour, as Chriſte ſhewed here vnto this man that had the dropſye.</p>
                  <p>Thirdely, The Phariſes ſtyl remaining in their blyndnes, and ſo that they could neither throughe Chriſtes wordes, nor yet through his myracles be moued to beeleue, Chriſte payed them home, and foraſmuch as he perceaued in them a deſirous appe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of vaine glory, and euer choſing themſelues the vppermoſt ſeates at feaſtes, and ſayd:<note place="margin">Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> phariſes</note> When thou art bidde to dinner to a mariage, thou ſhalt not ſet thy ſelfe in the highgeſt place, leſt peraduenture one that is more honourable then thou, be alſo bidden.

With theſe wordes Chriſt would haue corrected the ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the pha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſeis. For they ſought the glory of thys world, and were in their hartes al giuen to pomp and pride,<note place="margin">Mat. 23</note> As he ſaith in an other place, That all the workes they did, were done for the intent, that thei might be ſeen of men.<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> And in the ſyxt chap. of Math. wher Chriſt taught vs truly to pray, to faſt, &amp; giue almes. Ther likewiſe hee warned vs to take heede of ſuche pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeis, and not to do good works in that intent, like as thei did, &amp; ther he addeth, ſayi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: Thei haue recea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued their reward. He hath teached vs here myſtical<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, that if any man be called to the mariage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly grace, he muſt not bee pufte vp, nor yet thinke of him ſelfe more then becometh him, but rather he ought to take heed, that he beareth hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfe vpright
<pb facs="tcp:9767:150"/> and be euer in feare, leſt he leeſe the goodnes and gifts that he hath receiued.

Therefore whoſoeuer with this ſinner choſeth him the loweſt place, &amp; knowledgeth his ſinne, and aſketh grace, Chriſt ſhal ſet him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> higheſt place, &amp; geue hym euerlaſtinge life.

                  <p>FIrſt, we haue in this goſpell of this daye a queſtion of the lawe, wherin is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, what they be that moue this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and what their intent was. The Phariſeis were the chieffeſt, and counted the holyeſt amongeſt the Iewes people, whiche euer boaſted of workes, and diſputed of the ſame. A certaine doctoure of the lawe, whome the phariſees had appointed, moued this queſtion here, bycauſe they feared, leſt yt ſhuld chaunce vnto theim, as it did vnto the Saduces. Neither was it meruaile, thoughe thoſe iuſtifiers of them ſelues, reaſoned of the greateſt and chiefeſt commaundement of the lawe, for all their boaſting was in woorkes, all theyr laboure and dylygence was to bee iuſtified and bleſſed, and all throughe works. Which falſe opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſo growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their hartes, that the prophetes, Chriſt, &amp; alſo the Apoſtelles endeuoured theym ſelues greatly, to reforme it, but it was for the moſte parte all in vayne. Wherefore the phariſees do here according to the comon ſaying, which alſo was vſed of Chriſte in an other place, ſaying:<note place="margin">Mat. 12</note> Out of the aboundance of the hart, the mouth ſpeaketh. They vnderſtode the vertue of faith, Wherfore they muſt needes fal into hypocriſie, which euer is repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto faith. And hereout it chaunced that thei ſo ſtifly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtoode
<pb facs="tcp:9767:151"/> Chriſte, was the true doctoure of faith and truthe. They reaſon with Chriſte, but not of a good zeale, as wee maye lightly perceiue in this goſpell. The text is thus. One of them a ſcribe, tempted him. &amp;c. There is a difference when a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ignorance doth queſtion of a thing out of a good intent and for his erudition, &amp; whan he goth about to tempte a man. For he that of a good zeale,<note place="margin">To te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt.</note> aſketh any queſtion, he doth it to learne, bicauſe he is ignorant therin. And he that tempteth a man, he doth it for that intent &amp; purpoſe, to trippe him in his ſaying. Wherefore in that the phariſeis queſtioned not with Chriſt of no good intent,<note place="margin">Malyce &amp; wicked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> but for to tempt him, wee maye learne therout the maliciouſnes of our nature. For that is ſo rooted and grafte in vs, that by no meanes wee can knowledge the truthe or beleue Chriſte, excepte we be tranſformed into a new creature, through the worde &amp; the holy ghoſte.<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> For yf we wil not perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally remaine indurate and blind, we muſt be pulled therfrom, and learned by the holy ghoſte.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, conſidre now this queſtion well, &amp; alſo the anſwer of Chriſt. And although thoſe pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeis did not put forth this queſtion of a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, yet for all that the doctour of the law was not ſo ſtyffe necked nor yet ſo ſtubborne. Surely Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes anſwere and ſolution did like him ſo well, in ſo muche that Chriſte himſelfe ſaide, that he was not farre wide from the kingedome of God, as ſayncte Marke therein teſtifieth.<note place="margin">Mar. 12</note> The queſtion was this. Mayſter, which is the chiefeſt commaundement in the law? Whervnto Chriſt anſwered: Thou ſhalte loue the lord thy god with al thy hart, with all thy
<pb facs="tcp:9767:151"/> ſoule, and with all thy mynd. And addeth: This is the fyrſt and greateſt commaundement. And the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is lyke vnto it:<note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> Thou ſhalte loue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure as thy ſelfe. In theſe two commaundements hang all the law &amp; the prophetes. O what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent anſwer, if the Phariſes could haue vnderſtand it. For Chriſt reherſeth not here only two comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, but alſo teacheth that in them hange the whole lawe and the prophetes. Which muſte be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtande in this wiſe. The lawe (as witneſſeth S. Paule) is ſpirituall. that is,<note place="margin">Rom. 7 The law is fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſpirite</note> the lawe cannot be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled with outward works, but requireth the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hart, The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the hart ought to be wholy directed to the loue of god, ſo that wee ſhuld neither cleaue to workes, nor yet to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then muſte I needes haue faithe, This faithe the holy ghoſt worketh in me throughe the worde. And when I haue this true faithe, then doo I all thynge wyllyngelye that the lawe aſketh of me, and not conſtrained out of loue, and not for feare.<note place="margin">Faythe.</note> And I do not onlie that the firſt table of Moyſes requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of me, but alſo I do that the ſecond commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth me. For I doo beleue and truſt that the lorde my god is he that will ſaue me throughe Chriſt, of his great mercy and grace, without any deſeruyng of my partye. Furthermore, I loue my neighboure as my ſelfe, for I count his pouertye, tribulation and miſery, to be mine, and all that he ſuffreth, as thoughe I ſuffered my ſelfe. Hereout cometh, that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I do what ſo euer is acceptable vnto mi neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boure, and leue the thinge that is preiudyciall and hurtefull vnto him, then the fulfillyng of the lawe
<pb facs="tcp:9767:152"/> is adſcribed vnto loue. And that mayeſt thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue &amp; finde in the epiſtle to the Romaines, where S. Paule writeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 13</note> that hee that loueth his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, hath fulfilled the lawe. For thou ſhalt not be an aduouterer, thou ſhalt not kyll, thou ſhalte not ſteale, thou ſhalt beare no falſe witnes, thou ſhalte not deſier, and yf there be anye other commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is comprehended in this ſaying: Loue thy neighboure as thy ſelfe. And thoughe the lawe bothe requireth faythe and loue, yet ſtyll it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a worde of wrath and angre, whyle ſhe geueth me not the ſpirite to doo that ſhee commaundeth. Thou wylte ſaye vnto me: Why then is the lawe geuen, and what is her office? I aunſwere with S. Paule:<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> By the lawe commeth the knowledge of ſyn. &amp;c. and for this pourpoſe ſhee ſerueth and is neceſſarye. Shee bringeth me to the knowledge of imbecillitie and weakenes, peruerſe and frowarde nature, ſynnes, which canne throughe no worke be expelled &amp; dryuen away, ſo than that I by that mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes am made the apter &amp; redyer, to hear &amp; embrace y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of Chriſt of the diuine grace &amp; goodnes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdely, like as we haue had in this goſpell a queſtion partaininge to the lawe, ſo wee haue here nowe an other queſtion partaininge to the goſpell. After that an anſwere was giuen vnto the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees according to their queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was the fyrſt and greateſt commaundement in the lawe, Chriſte aſked them again ſayi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: What think ye of Chriſt? whoſe ſon is he?

And while they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt therin, knew not how Chriſt was the ſon and the lorde of Dauid, they ſhewed them ſelfe to haue little vnderſtanding in the miſtery of the goſpell. And although the Phariſees had no vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding therin, yet al they that will be counted chriſten men, muſte both know it, and beleue it. For what other thinge is the goſpell, then a ſwete and comfortable preaching of Chriſte the ſonne of Dauid? that hee for vs became man, and came into the worlde, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme &amp; ſaue vs through his death &amp; paſſion? And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he is called (as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh) the ſon of Dauid,<note place="margin">Whoſe ſonne Chriſt is</note> is for the greate &amp; excellent promiſe, that was made of Chriſt vnto Dauid.

This ſo excellent a miſtery is hidden from the Phariſees, &amp; all that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them ſelues, but vnto vs that know &amp; worſhip the father in Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt in the father, it is plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly opened &amp; well knowen. This preaching of Chriſt that he is the ſonne and lord of Dauid, agreeth wel with the queſtion of the law. The lawe openeth ſin, but it forgiueth not ſinne, for that high power is on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly giuen vnto Chriſt our lord the ſon of Dauid. Al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo the lawe teacheth, what we ought to do and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere, but ſhe giueth not the ſpirite, which canne do that the lawe commaundeth.

This man that had the palſey, prayeth and deſireth onely for his bodily health, and Chriſt healeth him both in body and ſoule, yea, and maketh him the ſonne and heyre of God, and ſayth: Sonne be of a good chere. O vnſpeakeable charitee, whiche can not bee expreſſed.

<pb facs="tcp:9767:154"/> and get, another mannes fayth ſhall healpe me but a litle in my laſt ende, in the point death. Therfore the goſpel here ſayth plainly, That Chriſt ſawe the fayth of them that brought this diſeaſed man. For ſurely thoſe honeſt men had heard a good report of Chriſt, and paraduenture had ſeene alſo, with what great beneuolence and charitee Chriſt had healed thoſe that were diſeaſed, hauyng therby great truſt and confidence, that he likewyſe would not forſake them. This their great fayth &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence is plainly expreſſed in that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were not only not aſhamed to cary this ſicke man in his bed, but alſo (as ſainct Marke teſtifieth) inſomuch as thei could not come nigh Chriſt for the multitude of people,<note place="margin">Mar. 2.</note> they vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the rooffe of the houſe where he was, &amp; when they had made a hole, they let doune the bedde by cordes, wherein the ſicke of the Palſey laye. With this fayth ſurely they moued Chriſt to reſtore this ſicke man vnto health, to receiue him, and to make him the ſonne of God. And ſurely it muſt needes be that this man that had the palſey, did comprehend this article of remiſſion of ſynne, &amp; that with fayth, or els his ſynne had neuer been forgeuen him, as wytneſſeth ſcripture:<note place="margin">Mat. 17</note> He that beleueth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſhalbe ſaued. He ſayth not: If another bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for thee &amp;c.

                  <p>Thyrdly we ſee here, how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Scribes &amp; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeis toke Chriſt for a blaſphemer of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, when Chriſt knew their thoughtes, how he anſwered theim. For he could in no wyſe ſuffre this contumely and blaſphemye. But conſider the Scribes, foraſmuche as they had red in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, that God alonely forgeueth ſinne, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng Chriſt to bee but a ſymple man, they thought that Chriſt with thoſe wordes had highly diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and blaſphemed God, chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gyng vnto him the honour that belonged vnto God. Wherewith they declare and euidently ſhewe, that they knewe not Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iho. 18</note> nor alſo the father, whiche wilbe knowen in Chriſt. It is ſurely true and can not be denyed, that God only forgeueth ſynne. But here muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and knowen, that Chriſt is very God, whiche alſo hath power to remit ſynnes.<note place="margin">Mat. 28</note> And the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer gaue he vnto his churche, that in his name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſynnes ſhould be annou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced vnto thende of the world. Wherfore Chriſt doth reprehend here the Scribes, forbecauſe they ſhould comme to the true knowlege. He iudgeth their thoughtes, which was aboue all mannes vnderſtandyng &amp; learnyng. And finally, with this great miracle he declareth him ſelfe to haue power here vpon yearth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue ſynne, and ſayth to him that had the Palſey: Aryſe, take thy bedde and go home. And he aroſe and went home. But the Scribes and Phariſeis remayned ſtyll in their blyndnes, and would not knowe Chriſtes high power.</p>

                  <p>THis Goſpell agreeth almoſte with the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude which is written in the fourtenth chapiter of S. Luke, of the which we haue a parte ſpoken of on the fyrſte ſondaye after Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitye ſondaye, And as the grace of the goſpell is there likened vnto a ſupper, ſo is it here likened vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to a mariage, Howbeit, the vnion and couplyng of Chriſt with the church, &amp; in what wiſe he hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, and maried her vnto him by faith, is here more plainly and more euidently ſette forth and declared by this mariage, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there, through the parable of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſouper. For it is true, that euen as a ſouper here v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth, is prepared and ordained for mirth and ioyfulnes, ſo likewiſe there is perpetual peace &amp; ioy in the kingdom of Chriſt. But in a mariage ther is not onli ioy, but the bridegrome &amp; the bride ar made one fleſh,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture teſtifieth: For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe ſhal a man forſake father &amp; mother, &amp; ſtycke to his wife, &amp; they ſhalbe two in one fleſh.<note place="margin">Oſe. 2.</note> And euen likewiſe as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bride &amp; the bridegrome ar one fleſh, ſo ſhal we be in Chriſt one body, ſo that wee haue a true faithe. And as a man and his wife haue al their goodes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon betwene them ſo haue we likewiſe al that was Chriſtes, ſo that we are not founde vnfaithful. To this pertaineth that S. Paule writeth to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſians:<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> You men loue your wiues, as Chriſt loued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> congregacion, &amp; hathe giuen himſelfe for it to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie it, and clenſe it in the fountaine of water, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, to make it vnto him ſelf a glorious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregaci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, hauing no ſpot nor wrinkle nor any ſuch thing,
<pb facs="tcp:9767:156"/> but that it ſhulde be holy and without blame.</p>
                  <p>Secondarely,<note place="margin">The out<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde worde.</note> ther is commended in this goſpel the outward word. wherthrough we are called and bidden to this mariage. For euen as gorgeouſly as he prepared this mariage with all thinges belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thervnto, ſo diligently by his ſeruauntes, he ſendeth and calleth his geſtes. Fyrſt of al through the word of the goſpell the Iewes were called vnto this mariage, to whome alſo Chriſt was promiſed, as we finde in the eightene chap. of Deutronomy.<note place="margin">Deut. 18</note> And were called alſo againe the ſeconde time, and would not yet come. For thei were ſo combred with worldly thinges, that they cared not for the welthe of their ſoule, and therefore were forſaken and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demned, in whoſe place the poore Fentiles ſuccede. And that it is here ſpoken, that they gathered togi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther al that they found both good &amp; euel, that is not ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we ſhuld think,<note place="margin">Mar. 23</note> that the ill men for their maliciouſnes, ſhall receiue a ſpecial reward in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,<note place="margin">Mat. 25</note> but that we muſt ſuffre to grow here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth the tares with the good wheat, vnto ſuch tyme, that god by Chriſt ſhall deuide the ſheep from the kyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and receiue the ſheepe into his kingedome.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdely, in that the Iewes didde contempne and diſpiſe the woorde of god and the goſpell, and diſtroyed the miniſters therof, wherwith the kinge being angry, ſent forth his warriers, and deſtroyed thoſe murtherers, and ſette fier vppon their citye.

Truely I ſay vnto you, it ſhal be eaſyer for the lande of Sodoma and Gomorra, in the day of iudgement, then for that citie.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we haue in this parable, him whiche entred in w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out a weddyng garment, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to be bound &amp; caſt into vtter darkenes, becauſe he could not excuſe him ſelfe. That, that is ſpoken here of the wedding garment, is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtand of thoſe that iuſtifye them ſelfes. For thoſe though outwardly thei appeare to be good &amp; holy, yet forbecauſe they bee hypocrites,<note place="margin">The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</note> they ſhall not entre with Chriſt into the kyngdome of heauen.</p>
                  <p>There is onely but one worke, where through wee are iuſtifyed and ſaued, whiche is the merites of Chriſt. And whoſoeuer receiueth this worke with a right and vnfayned fayth, he weareth that wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng garment, and in that great day ſhall he entre with Chriſt into his kyngdome.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> But without this veſture of fayth, it is vnpoſſible to pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>But they therfore that haue not this veſture (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,<note place="margin">The wed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyng gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</note> though many bee called, yet is there but a fewe that hath it) they ſhall not haue part with Chriſte, but with Sathan.

For it is better not to be heard in our prayer and receiue therwith ſaluacion, then to obtain our petition and owne wyll, in thinges beinge to our damnacion. Of this mynd was alſo S.

He prayeth for health, but in ſuche wiſe, that the thing whiche hee deſyereth, bee neither againſte God, nor the ſaluacion of hys ſoule. And ſo lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe oughte wee to praye, that what ſo euer we deſyer, ſhulde bee referred vnto the wyll of God.</p>

                  <p>Fyrſte, we heare in this parable, a certaine part of the lawe.

It muſt be fulfilled and done with al thy hart with al thy ſoule, and with all thy might, according as god hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded it. And foraſmuche as the ſaintes and the elect of god, often times do ſtumble here &amp; offend, and haue need to praye vnto god, for to obtaine forgiuenes of their ſinnes at all houres, how ſhall an ypocrite then be iuſtified beefore god, through his workes? For the prophete Dauid did not pray without a cauſe,<note place="margin">Pſ. 142.</note> when he ſaid: Lord enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruaunte, For in thy ſyght ſhal no man liuing be ſaued. And in an other place,<note place="margin">Pſal. 31.</note> he ſaith: Bleſſed are they, whoſe vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes is forgiuen, and whoſe ſinnes ar couered.

This ſeruant promiſed to paye it all (as troubled conſciences are wont to do) but the kyng knewe well that it was impoſſible for him to doo. Wherfore he diſcharged him, and forgaue him of very pitie and mercy, the debt frely. Out of all this we muſt learne, from whence forgeuenes of ſynnes commeth. For remiſſion of ſynne ſtandeth not in workes or in any deſeruyng, but is graunted and geuen vs frely by Chriſt, of mere grace &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. For why would this kyng haue had mercy of this ſeruant and forgeue him, if he had had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to paye?

And thou canſt neuer bee ſure of this article, if thou do leane and haue confidence in woorkes or merites. Wherfore, if thou deſireſt a peaceable conſcience, thou muſt comprehende the great grace and mercy of God in Chriſte, and that through fayth. And if thou doeſt perceiue this, thou haſt on thy ſyde the holy Goſpel, that euery where aſcribeth remiſſion of ſynnes vnto the grace of God, &amp; not to thy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.<note place="margin">Ihon. 1.</note> Dyd not ſainct Ihon Baptiſt declare euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Chriſt was the Lamme of God, that taketh away the ſynnes of the worlde?

And here on this parable we haue, howe the kyng of great mercy and compaſſion forgaue this debt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this ſeruant ſhould haue been myndful of the great benefite whiche was ſhewed vpon him, and by right ſhould haue had pacience with him that was in his debte, foraſmuche as fayth, whiche comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth remiſſion of ſynnes in Chriſt, is euer wont accuſtomably to come vnto light and breake furth through charitee. But as an vnthankefull, &amp; forgetfull man of ſuche great goodnes done vnto him, he would haue no pacience with his companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche ought him an hundreth pence. Doth this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeme vnto the a chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although his ſynne afore was dimitted him? No ſurely. For a chriſtian
<pb facs="tcp:9767:162"/> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knoweth, that of mere grace through Chriſt, his ſynnes bee forgeuen him: and knoweth alſo that in like maner he ſhould handle his neighbor. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that I apprehende forgeuenes of ſynne by fayth in Chriſt, and for Chriſtes ſake ſerue and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue my neighbour, in ſo doyng and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuyng in the ſame I am a chriſtian man, Whiche if I do not, I am no chriſtian man.<note place="margin">Mat. 22</note> For the ſcripture witneſſeth that all the lawe and the Prophetes hang and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the loue of God and my neighbour, as in two of the principal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.<note place="margin">Luc. 6.</note> Wherfore Chriſt in another place ſaith: Forgeue, and you ſhalbe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen. Whiche thou mayſt not vnderſtande, as though thou couldeſt deſerue remiſſion of ſynnes throug thy forgeuyng. The fyrſt part of this know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lege, is the preachyng of repentaunce, declaryng vnto the, what thou oughteſt to do with thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, namely to forgeue him. And the ſecond parte is a promiſe, that thy ſynnes ſhalbe forgeuen the in Chriſt, by grace and mercy. And hereto pertayneth our dayly prayer, wherin we ſay: <hi>Remitte nobis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bita noſtra &amp;c.</hi> Forgeue vs oure dettes, as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue oure detters. Wherfore if thou haue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to do good workes, to teſtifie by charitie that thy fayth is a right &amp; a true fayth in Chriſte, ſerue thy neighbor, as God by his ſonne hath ſerued the. For by this ſhall euery man knowe, that ye are the diſciples of Chriſt, if you haue loue one to another, as Chriſt ſayth in the xiiii. chapiter of Ihon.<note place="margin">Iho. 14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we ſee in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth part of this parable howe God ſhall puniſhe thoſe that leaue &amp; departe from the fayth, &amp; forget the charitee and loue,<note place="margin">The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thoſe that do fall from fayth.</note> that
<pb facs="tcp:9767:163"/> they owe to their neighbor. For aſſone as the kyng had heard howe extremely the ſeruaunt, to whom he had forgeuen his debt, had handled his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he was very wrothe. Wherfore he called him before him, and rigorouſly rebuked him, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him to the iaylours vntyll he payed all that he ought. This worde, Vntyl, ſignfieth here, tyme without ende. As though the kyng would ſaye. Of my great mercye and grace I forgaue thee all thy ſynnes, that thou beyng myndefull of this great benefite, ſhouldeſt haue likewiſe ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled thy debter. But forſomuche as thou arte ſo vnthankefull, and haſt vtterly forgotten charitee, thou ſhalt be damp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned euerlaſtyngly. Out of all theſe thynges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, howe euery thyng ought to bee done in the kyngdome of Chriſt. Fyrſt we ought to knowlege our ſelfe to be ſynners, and that we cannot be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſight of God by workes. And that is the fyrſt parte of this parable. Secondarily we muſt knowe, that oure ſynnes bee forgeuen vs of grace through Chriſt, and that teacheth the ſecond parte of this parable. And thyrdly wee are here taught, that when we haue receiued remiſſion of ſynne by fayth, it is needefull that we by charitee teſtifie to haue this fayth. Fourthly, wee bee here taught, that if wee do not theſe foreſayd thynges, wee ſhall be dampned without mercy, &amp; that is the laſt parte of this parable. Geue thankes vnto God.</p>

Wherout we may learne the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe hypocrites, which perſecute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of god.

                  <p>Secondarily, after that the Phariſeys had put furth their ſubtill deuiſed queſtion, &amp; Chriſt kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng that thei did it to tempt him, ſo he did anſwer them, that it was not ſpoken in vayne of the wyſe
<pb facs="tcp:9767:165"/> man,<note place="margin">Pro. 21.</note> ſaiyng: There is no wyſedome, there is no vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng, there is no counſail againſt the Lord. Therfore he calleth them hypocrites. And that thei might wel vnderſtand, that he knewe their malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughtes, he added: Why do ye tempte me? Whiche wordes by right ſhould haue reuoked the Phariſeys and the miniſters from their maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and deceit, and cauſed them to haue amended their liues. But they were blynde &amp; remayned ſtyll blynd. Yet notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng, Chriſt bad them to ſhewe him their tribute money, and ſayd: Whoſe is this ymage &amp; ſuperſcripcion? They ſayd vnto him: The Emperours. Then ſayd he vnto them: Geue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnto the Emperour that, whiche is the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and geue vnto God that whiche is Gods. As though he would ſaye: Foraſmuche as you are come therto, that for your ſynne you are brought vnder the yoke of the Emperour of Rome, you muſt nedes geue, as vnto your head &amp; higheſt lorde here vpon yearth vnder God, that whiche belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Here is to be noted, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> difference that Chriſt maketh betwene the kyngdome of God and this worlde. For he doth not onely approue and allowe this high power and polliticke life,<note place="margin">The ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt.</note> but alſo confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it. For the kyngdome of God or of Chriſt, is ſpiritual, whiche conſiſteth in the ſpirite, fayth, and truth, wherfore it commeth not with outwarde do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynges, but it muſt be inwardly in vs. Now becauſe that it is a ſpiritual kyngdome, God requireth and wyll be worſhypped in ſpirite,<note place="margin">Luc. 17 Ihon. 4</note> and in the trueth, as Chriſt ſayth in the fourth chapiter of ſainct Ihon. The true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the father in
<pb facs="tcp:9767:165"/> ſpirite and in truthe. But to worſhip God in ſpirite and truth, is, to loue him with all thy heart,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> with all thy power, and to truſte in him. For ſuche fayth and loue, geueth God his honor, and kepeth his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, as Chriſt ſayeth in an other place: He that loueth me, ſhall keepe my woorde.<note place="margin">Ioh. 14</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when I put my whole truſte in god the father, through Chriſte, and loue him aboue all creatures, then doo I gyue god that pertaineth to god, and pull from him none of his honour. And herevnto pertaineth the fruteful admonicion of the prophete Dauid, ſaying:<note place="margin">Pſal. 28.</note> Adſcribe vnto the Lorde O yee mighty, aſcribe vnto the Lord worſhyp &amp; ſtrength.

Therfore, ſeyng they rule in gods ſteed it is both meete and conuenient, to giue theim that wee are bounde to giue theim. But what are thoſe thinges? S. Paule ſetteth them furthe, and ſayth:
<pb facs="tcp:9767:166"/> Geue vnto euery man his dutie,<note place="margin">Ro 13.</note> Tribute, to whom tribute belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth, Cuſtome, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cuſtome is due, Feare, to whom feare belongeth, honour, to whom honour pertayneth.

                  <head>THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                  <p>WE haue two examples of fayth in this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. One in the Ruler that came to Chriſt to get helpe for his doughter, whiche Ruler ſainct Marke calleth Iayrus. And another in the woman that was diſeaſed with a bluddy fluxe, and healed by Chriſte. In this woman was a perfecte ſayth, but the rulers fayth as yet was not perfect, but weake.</p>
                  <p>Fyrſt, it was a point of fayth in this ruler, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he beleued that Chriſt could rayſe his daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter to life, though ſhe were dead: wherewith he con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſeth Chriſt to be God, and a Lorde ouer life and death. Then if Chriſte bee a Lorde ouer death, he muſt nedes bee a Lorde ouer ſynne (foraſmuche as Adam through his ſynne, brought death into the worlde) and ſuche a Lorde dothe of death and of ſynne is he, that both death and ſynne by his death he hath ouercome, abrogated and taken away. But howe and to what purpoſe? That they ſhould haue no power to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dempne vs that beleue in Chriſt. For vndoubtedly, we can not liue without ſynne, whyle wee bee in this mortal life, as it is written:<note place="margin">Pro. 24</note> A iuſt man falleth vii. tymes in a day, &amp; ryſeth vp againe. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſynne (ſo that we beleue) ſhal haue no power ouer vs, nor condempne vs. Lykewiſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> although
<pb facs="tcp:9767:167"/> this naturall death is not cleane taken awaye, yet is it ſo ouerthrowne, that it is no more dampnable vnto vs, but is the beginnyng of the true &amp; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal life,<note place="margin">Iho. 11</note> as Chriſt ſaith: He that beleueth in me, ſhal not dye euerlaſtyngly. This muſt wee ſurely holde faſt if we will be chriſtian menne, That is, we muſt beleue, that by the death and bloud of Chriſt, wee are deliuered from ſynne, death, deuil and hell, ſo that we perſeuer in a true fayth, we ſhall haue euerlaſtyng life through Chriſt. And this beleueth Iayrus partly. But in aſmuche that he beleueth not that Chriſte by the might &amp; power of his worde could make whole his doughter, except he had been perſonally preſent, we muſt nedes confeſſe that his fayth was imperfect. But what ſhall we ſay of the fayth of this woman? She ſurely had ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fidence in Chriſt, that ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded by her ſelfe, that ſhe ſhould bee whole, if ſhe might touche only the hemme of his veſture. Not that the veſture dyd make her whole, (for as S. Marke ſayth, he felte great vertue go from him, and ſpeaketh nothyng of the veſture) but only the great fayth that ſhe had in Chriſt. Wherfore Chriſt highly prayſeth and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayth of this woman, ſaiyng: Doughter be of good comforte, thy fayth hath made the ſafe. Lo, there thou haſt an example both of perfect and vnperfect fayth.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, we ſee in this goſpel howe frendly and familiarly Chriſte ſuffered the weakenes and imbecilitie of this Ruler, and with the miracle done vnto the woman, augmentyng and bryngyng him to more parfect fayth. For he ſheweth himſelfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
<pb facs="tcp:9767:167"/> at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſire of Iayrus, &amp; foloweth him ſtraight wayes home, declaryng with his dede that whiche he had taught before, ſaiyng:<note place="margin">Mat. 11</note> Come to me al ye that labour and are laden, &amp; I wyll eaſe you. But what happened in the way? Beholde, a woman that had been diſeaſed xii. yere with an iſſue of bloudde, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng her peace, by fayth gat and obtayned health. She had determined alſo by her ſelfe, that in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng her peace, and in ſilence, would haue gone home againe.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> But as a citie buylded vpon an high hyll, can not be hyd, ſo likewyſe it was neither mete nor yet conuenient, that ſuche great, high, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent fayth, ſhould be hyd. And dothe not Chriſte ſay in the Goſpell:<note place="margin">Mat. 10</note> There is nothyng hyd that ſhal not bee openly ſhewed, and nothyng ſecrete that ſhall not be knowen? So likewyſe he wyl, that the fayth of this woman ſhould be manyfeſt &amp; brought to light. And enquireth and ſayth: Who hath tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched me? The Apoſtles ignoraunt of this miracle, anſwered him and ſayd: The people thruſte thee. But the woman feared and trembled, for ſhe knewe what was done in her, came and fell doune before him and tolde him the whole truth. Wherin Chriſt commendeth her fayth before al the people, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that this ſhould bee an example for the people to folowe, but alſo to ſtrength Iayrus fayth, that he ſhould not doubte, but that ſuche benignitee and mercy as was ſhewed vnto this woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe bee ſhewed vnto his daughter. Could Chriſte behaue him ſelfe more gentely, or bee indued with greatter loue, mekenes, pitie and mercy? He decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb facs="tcp:9767:168"/> with the very deede, that he can helpe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour vs in all trouble &amp; neceſſitee, yea in the point of death, and is ready and willyng therto. But we of our nature are ſo indurate, deaffe and blind, that we wil neither with holſome doctrin and teachyng, nor yet with miracle be moued vnto fayth. Truely it is to be feared, leſt we take and receiue like ende with the ſtyffe necked and blynde Iewes. For wee can not excuſe oure ſelues, but the ſame that was ſpoken vnto the Iewes, might likewyſe be ſpoken vnto vs,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.</note> where Chriſte ſayd: If I my ſelfe had not come and ſpoken vnto theim, then ſhould they haue had no ſinne. Is not Chriſt come through his goſpel, and hath ſhewed the ſame? Do we not heare his worde dayly? but when do we heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame for any ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of our life? I pray the take it once to heart, and remembre the goodnes, frendlynes, &amp; myldenes of Chriſte, howe louyngly through his worde and miracles, he intyſeth &amp; allureth vs vnto fayth. Howe familiarly he taketh and ſuffereth our imbecilitee and weakenes, and howe feruently he deſireth vs to be iuſt and bleſſed. Let theſe thynges ſo moue vs, that by the meditacion hereof, we may not only encreaſe in fayth, but perſeuer in the ſame, and therby get euerlaſtyng ſaluacion.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdly wee ſee in this miracle, howe the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of Chriſte are counted and adiudged in the world for fooliſhenes, yea and are ſkorned and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed. For Chriſt ſaiyng: The mayd is not dead but ſleapeth, what did they but laught him to ſkorne?</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9767:168"/>
                  <p>Doeſt thou not thinke it a miſerable thynge, that the creature ſhuld ſcorne his maker, creatour of all thinges? That vngracious and blynde fleſhe, ſton<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth well in his owne conceite, and thinkinge him ſelfe to haue done a highe feate, when it doth bothe ſcorne, deride, and blaſpheme the doctrine, workes, and myracles of Chriſte, ye his harte in his bodye laughed at it. But what get they thereby? Herken, The people is put forth, that they ſhuld not be pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent, at the rayſing of this dead vnto lyfe. Lo, ſo it goeth with them, that ſcorne and diſpiſe the goſpel of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> that god giueth theym vp vnto ſhameful luſtes, and blyndeth their fooliſhe hartes, ſo that they ſhal neither ſe nor vnderſtand the great miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of the death and reſurrection of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> but ſhalbe euerlaſtingly dampned. Herevnto is to bee referred the ſaying of Dauid the prophete, ſaying:<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.</note> Bleſſed is the man, that goeth not in the councell of the vngodly, that abideth not in the way of ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſetteth not in the ſeate of the ſcornefull. But delyteth in the lawe of the lorde, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelfe in his lawe, bothe daye and nyghte. Scorners calleth Dauid here all thoſe, that thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all to be both foolyſhnes and trifles, that god hath ſpoken and doone.<note place="margin">Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> And hee counteth theym bleſſed, that medle not and haue nothinge to doo with ſuche ſcorners. Out alas, howe full is the worlde nowe a dayes of ſuche ſcorners? They bee counted glorious and goodly felowes in this world whiche ſcorne, diſpiſe, perſecute and blaſpheme
<pb facs="tcp:9767:169"/> the woorde of <hi>CHRIST.</hi> They bee loued and muche made of, yee with goodes and ryches ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated, ſo that they ſhall lacke nothyng, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceaſe to ſkorne Chriſt and his membres. But good menne ſhall here thynke and haue in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, howe this is not onely chaunſed vnto theim, but afore tyme hath ſuche like blaſphemye happened to our ſauiour Ieſu Chriſte. For if they haue called the good man of the houſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 10</note> Belzebub, howe muche more ſhall they call them of his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde ſo? Beſydes this, wee haue alſo a cauſe of greate conſolacion and comforte, inſomuche as our quarel is iuſt, godly, conformable, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Goddes holy woorde. For wee can not glorifye God more highely, then to adſcribe vnto his onely begotten ſonne, whom he hath for great loue and mercy that he bare vs, ſent into the worlde to bee crucifyed, to bee our righteouſnes, holynes, and redempcion, ſo that we may remayne and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly ſtande nowe in him as oure onely ſaluacion. For if we ſhould adſcribe vnto our workes, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes or ſaluacion, we could neuer be ſure. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore lette all the worde ſkorne, blaſpheme, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute this our doctryne. Hereof wee are ſure, that God, Chriſt, the woorde of God and all the Angels in heauen, bee all on oure ſyde. From the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, the preachyng of the goſpel was fooliſhenes vnto the Gentyles, and occaſion of fallyng vnto the Iewes,<note place="margin">1.

For he doth not onlye preache and offre vnto all men ſaluacion freely and willynglye, but alſo hee wyll geue it vnto all thoſe that hope and truſte in him, onlye by his propre merites and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, without any reſpecte of our works, yee of mere grace and mercy,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note> according to the ſaying of Saint Iohn, which ſaith: The lawe is geuen by Moyſes, but grace and truthe by Ieſus Chriſte.<note place="margin">The ſum of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Chriſte.</note> Now perad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenture thou wilte demaund of me, what the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge of Chriſte was, and the ſome thereof. In ſhorte woordes he ſpake as foloweth: Amend your ſelues, for the kinkedome of heauen is at hande. To amende our ſelues, to walke in a newe lyfe, and to forſake our olde vitious lyuynge, requireth the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of penaunce. And foraſmuch as the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel of the grace of god, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth little vtilitie or profite to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, except he firſt be brought to the knowledg of his offences &amp; ſinnes,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> &amp; haue a contryte harte, therefore it is very requiſite &amp; neceſſary, that the lawe, whereby we be brought to the ſame knowledge, be euer fyrſte preached and taught:<note place="margin">The ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of heauen.</note> Whych done, the other foloweth: namelye this: The kyngedome of heauen is at hande. The
<pb facs="tcp:9767:172"/> kyngedome of heauen in this place, is taken for the godly grace of the goſpel, As though Chriſt would ſay: If I may this only thyng obtayn of you, that your ſynnes may earneſtly diſpleaſe you, &amp; aſke for grace with all your whole heart, it ſhal be brought to paſſe, that grace ſhall not bee denyed you. For nowe truely, that acceptable tyme and daies of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion be at hand, in the which remiſſion of ſynnes is not onely offered vnto you, but through my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and of mere grace, ſhalbe forgeuen you. At the leſt be warned of this, that you may knowe this tyme of viſitacon, and that you do not diſpiſe my worde. Here thou haſt out of the goſpell of ſainct Mathew, the true preacher of grace, and the whole ſomme of his preachyng, with the whiche Chriſte wyll haue his kyngdome begonne and miniſtred. But wyll he alone bee occupyed and charged with the adminiſtracion of the ſame? No truely. For as before this tyme he hath had miniſters and ſeruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, ſo likewyſe he wyll haue theim nowe.<note place="margin">Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of God</note> The Prophetes, and in eſpeciall ſainct Ihon Baptyſt, were needefull and very neceſſarye, to prepare the waye to this preachyng of grace. And ſo likewyſe as in his tyme, and alſo after his departyng, he would haue ſuche healpers (ſuche I ſay) as ſainct Paule nameth theim,<note place="margin">1. Ti. 5.</note> whiche faythfully and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſhould teache the woorde of God, and doo that laye in theim, to holde it in eſtimacion and his dignitee. But where ſhall he picke out thoſe, or gette ſuche? Shall he gette them in the highe ſchole at Athenes? or out of the noumbre
<pb facs="tcp:9767:173"/> of the doctoures in Egypte? Or els ſhall they bee found at Ieruſalem, where ſo great a company of honeſt Scribes &amp; Phariſeis are found? No verely: He wyl picke and choſe theim out of the nombre of laboryng menne. Why, and wherfore wyl he do ſo? Therfore, forbecauſe his doctrine was ſo vyle cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and had of ſo litle eſtimacion before the worlde, whiche doctrine wherſoeuer it is brought to light, for the moſte parte there foloweth perſecucion and mortall hatred. In ſomuche that ſainct Paule na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ſame woorde, The worde of the Croſſe. Alſo note and marke, euen as the worde is diſpiſed and abiected before the worlde, ſo ſhall likewiſe his miniſters bee.<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.</note> For the ſeruaunt is not greater then his maiſter.<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>But howe dyd Chriſte vſe this callyng? Ieſus walked (ſayth the Euangeliſt) by the ſea of Galile, he ſawe Simon Peter, and Adrewe his brother ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng a nette into the ſea, and ſayd vnto them: Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe me. The ſame ſone after dothe he to Iames and Iohn,<note place="margin">Two maner of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng.</note> whiche alſo were fyſhers. Where is to be noted, that there is two maner of callyng. The one is diſcribed in the fyrſt booke of Moſes where it is wrytten, that in the ſweate of thy face thou ſhalte eate thy bread. Whiche partayneth vnto all men. And thother is, when any man is called of God, or by ſome other lawefull meanes to bee a Kynge, a prince, a ruler of the common wealth, or
<pb facs="tcp:9767:173"/> choſen to be a preacher of goddes word. And thys pertayneth not vnto all men, but to a certaine. In the firſt callyng were the Apoſtels, wherein doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les as good and vertuous men, they wold haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained and abiden, in caſe they had not bene called to none other. After whoſe inſample are we bounde to abide in our calling. And if it fortune any man to be called to any office or dignitie concernyng the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And no manne taketh the honoure vnto hym ſelfe,<note place="margin">Hebre. 5</note> but hee that is called of God, as was Aaron.</p>
                  <p>Secondaryly,<note place="margin">The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles</note> after that Chriſte had ſegregated and called to him theſe fower Apoſtels frome their fyrſte callyng, hee declared what hee woulde doo with theim, and ſayeth: I wyll make you fyſhers of men. Fyſſhinge in this place is as much to ſay,<note place="margin">Fyſhing</note> as preachinge the woorde of god or the goſpell.</p>
                  <p>As wee haue alſo in the xiii. chapiter of Mathewe,<note place="margin">Mat. 13</note> Where hee lykeneth the kingedome of heauen to a nette, caſte into the ſea, wherewith are taken all manner of fyſſhes. For as a net is caſt into the ſea for none other intent or purpoſe, then ther to catch fiſh, ſo is it conuenient and meet that thei which by lawfull callynge come to the office of preachynge,
<pb facs="tcp:9767:174"/> ofte declare the worde of god, and that for none other intent, then to allure and bring men therby in the true faythe of Chriſte, to the laude and prayſe of god, and for the ſaluacion of their ſowles. As wee reade of Chriſte oure lorde, howe hee glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by good righte, bycauſe he ſoughte only the glorye of his father.<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. Luc. 19.</note> And in an other place, hee ſayeth: The ſonne of manne came to ſeeke and to ſaue that whyche was loſte. And when Chriſt ſpake theſe woordes of fyſſhynge,<note place="margin">Iere. 16</note> hee hadde a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte vnto the prophecye of Ieremye, whan hee ſaide: Beholde, I wyll ſende oute manye fiſſhers to take theim. Out of all theſe ſayinges a man may lightely gather, what Chriſte deſiered of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels, and what they were bounde to doo, whiche was nothinge elſe, but to preache and teache, and not to deuoure and ſlaye. For <hi>CHRIST</hi> neuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, that to fiſſhe, was as muche to ſaye, as to kyll and ſlaye, or to oppreſſe anye manne by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, but contrarye wyſe, to handle the worde of God with all faithfulnes and gentlenes, as wee haue in the laſte chapiter of Saynte Marke: Go your wayes (ſayeth Chriſte) into all the world and preache the Goſpell to all creatures. And Saynte Paule when he deſcribeth and informeth a Byſſhoppe,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.</note> hee requireth not of him, that hee ſhoulde be experte howe to handle a weapon, but that hee ſhoulde bee apte and meete to preache and teache.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note> For in the fyrſte Epiſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, hee declareth what a preacher is, and alſo ſetteth forthe his office, ſaying:</p>

Lyfte vppe thy voyce and bee not afrayde. We muſt needes confeſſe that all this is ſpoken of the office of preachyng and teachyng. What neede we many wordes? The office of a preacher is to teache, to rebuke, to comforte, to exhorte, and to be founde faythfull in his office. Therefore, he that wyll bee taken for a true preacher, ſhall not come to that madneſſe, for to drawe agayne ſainct Peters ſwoorde, whiche was ones putte into the ſheath. But all his authoritee and office ſtandeth in this, that he is bounde to remayne with ſainct Ihon Baptyſt, the voyce of a cryer,<note place="margin">Mat. 26 Eſai 40</note> or els he doth vſurpe another office, and ſhould rather bee named a ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious manqueller, then a preacher of the woorde of God.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdly this Goſpel declareth vnto vs the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſimplicitee of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">The obe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dience of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</note> whiche were called of Chriſte to preache. For aſſone as they heard this voyce of Chriſte: Come and folowe me. ſtraight wayes they did geue theim ſelues ouer into the wylle of God, were obedient, not diſputed whether it were lawefull &amp; meete to forſakee father
<pb facs="tcp:9767:175"/> and mother, wyfe and children, to folowe a man of ſo lytle reputacion before the world, as was Chriſt, but did euen as we reade in another place of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, when he was commaunded to go out of his countrey into a lande that God ſhould ſhewe him, he diſputed not whether he ſhould goo, or whether he might not ſerue God aſwel in his fathers houſe, as in a ſtraunge countrey, but moſt ſymply obeyed the worde of God. So likewyſe were theſe Apoſtles found obedient.<note place="margin">The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of God.</note> Wherfore that mightie woorde of God and the goſpell is highly to be magnified and extolled, which doth not onely penetrate the eares, but ſtryketh and toucheth the heart, Or els truely fleſhe and bloud had aſwell remayned diſobedient in the Apoſtles as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phariſeis. For they, though Chriſt neuer ſo ofte repeted and cryed vnto theim: Amende your ſelfe, the kyngdome of heauen is at hand. yet would they neither heare him nor folowe him. But where Chriſte cryeth aſwell in the heart as in the eare, there without any buſynes, willyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, men both heareth him and foloweth him. But when he cryeth onely but in the eare, then remayne we as blynde and as harde hearted, as that blynde Pharao did. Neuertheleſſe it is all our faulte that we do not heare and folowe Chriſt. Furthermore, wee ſhall with all diligence ſeeke Chriſte and bee feruent in hearyng of the Goſpell, foraſmuche as he ſayeth:<note place="margin">Luc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> Who ſo hath eares to heare, lette him heare. And though the Apoſtles are bound to geue thankes vnto God, and knowlege that it all came of him, in that they were ſo obedient and folowed
<pb facs="tcp:9767:175"/> Chriſte, yet is this wrytten for an example for vs, ſo that I knowe not how to geue greatter honour and worſhippe to the ſainctes,<note place="margin">The worſhip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping of ſaintes.</note> then when through their enſample I am induced to folowe Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And here is to be noted, that there is two maner of folowyng of Chriſte. The one is bodily wyſe,<note place="margin">The fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of Chriſt is two maner of wiſe. i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Of the bodily folowyng of Chriſte ſpeaketh this preſent Goſpell, and doth not pertayne vnto all menne, but vnto thoſe onely that be commaunded, as the Apoſtles wer, and alſo Abraham. Or when through the wyll of God, the Tyrantes of this worlde ſhall take thee from thy wyfe and children by violence, and put the to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion for the Goſpell ſake, And ſo there is Chriſt to bee folowed, not onely ſpiritually, but alſo bodily. For of that it is wrytten:<note place="margin">Mat. 10</note> Whoſoeuer denyeth me before men, him will I alſo denye before my father whiche is in heauen.<note place="margin">How to folowe Chriſt both ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually &amp; bodily.</note> The other folowyng of Chriſt is ſpiritual, &amp; partayneth vnto all chriſtian men. For as long as I determyne with my ſelfe to forſake all thynges that I haue in the worlde wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly, whenſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe God ſo to ordain it, yea and at all tymes am readye to dye for the truth ſake, ſo long I folowe Chriſte. And ſo may this ſpirituall folowyng of Chriſte ſtande, and bee acceptable before God, without the bodily folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng, as chaunſeth often tymes. But the bodily folowyng without the ſpiritual ought not to bee. For ſuche thynges ought in ſuche a chaunce bothe to be ioyned together. Wylte thou knowe nowe, in what wyſe thou ſhalt behaue and inſtruct thy ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:9767:176"/> herein? Herken to. If God ordaine it ſo, that thou muſt forſake all thyng, &amp; for the truth ſake ſuffereſt all aduerſitee, put awaye and expell from thee all feare, and be of good comforte, and folowe Chriſte faythfully, not conſideryng neither wyfe nor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> for great ſhal be thy rewarde in heauen. And although God doth not viſite the with ſuche afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and tribulacion, neuertheleſſe it is mete and conuenient that thy heart and mynde bee ſetteled, and vtterly perſuaded at all tymes to be ready to folowe Chriſt.

For in that to be willyng to ſuffre all trouble, perſecucion and pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when it ſhall pleaſe God to ſend it thee, is called the true obaiyng and folowyng of Chriſt.

And wherein I beſeche you may wee wretches glorifye in, when ſuche notable incredulite can be found in ſuche an Apoſtle? But for no other intent or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is this layde before vs, then onely that wee therby may learne to knowe the weakenes and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liciouſnes of our fleſhe.

<pb facs="tcp:9767:177"/> ſo in deede, what needed Chriſt to ſaye theſe words: Suppoſe you that the ſonne of man,<note place="margin">Luc. 28.</note> when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, ſhall finde faithe vppon earthe? Moreouer, what was the cauſe that the Apoſtels in the tyme of the reſurrection of Chriſt, were ſo rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raunt, in the matter of fayth and iuſtificacion? Nor it is not to be thought, that ſuche thinge happened only vnto S. Thomas, and not to the reſte of the Apoſteſts, except that wee wyll ſaye, that all ſuche tokens and actes which we fynde in the ſtory of the reſurrection of Chriſt (fyrſt doon through angels, and then by Chriſte himſelfe, whereby the Apoſtels in this article were confirmed) were vanities and lyes. I may ſuffre euery man to ſay herein his plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure. Yet doo I thus thinke, and can approue yt by many teſtimonies of ſcripture, that no mortal man, how well learned or wiſe ſo euer he be, how good or ſharpe witted ſo euer he be, can learne or be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the faith of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſte worketh faithe in vs. Eſai. 54</note> except the ſingular grace of the holy ghoſte drawe him and inſtruct him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The prophete ſayth: They ſhal be all taught of god, Then if I can inſtructe and teache my ſelfe in thoſe thinges, that concerne our faythe, what need hath god to teach me? Vpon this reaſon S. Iohn the euangelyſt, ſaith: Hee came into his owne,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note> and his owne receyued him not. If faith be ſuch a light and an eaſye thinge to come by, what was the cauſe that the Iewes were ſo ignoraunt in the comynge of their Meſſias, whiche were taught and brought vp in the lawe? Or for what cauſe dothe the lyghte ſhine in darkenes, and the darkenes can not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende it? Wherefore it is meete that wee learne
<pb facs="tcp:9767:178"/> hereout, that it is not in euery mannes power to haue fayth, but that it is a gyfte and a woorke of God only, as we fynde in this place of ſainct Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, that in no maner of wyſe he would beleue, excepte he ſawe with his eyen, and felte with his fyngers.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, wee fynde in this enſample howe paciently, and gently Chriſte ſuffereth ſuche imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitee and weakenes in his ſeruauntes. Yea, he turneth ſuche mekeneſſe into a ſtrong fayth. For as we reade in the hiſtory of the reſurrection, howe he fyrſt did appeare vnto the women and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſo he dothe ſeeme here likewyſe in this place vnto the vnfaythfull Thomas, becauſe he ſhould not ſtyl perſeuer in incredulitee, but ſhould become faythfull. He came the eight daye after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection vnto the diſciples, and beſydes that he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted theim with his peace, he ſhewed vnto Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas his handes and his feete, ſaiyng: Bryng thy fynger hither, and ſee my handes, and reche hether thy hande and thruſt it into my ſyde, and bee not faythleſſe, but beleuyng. Is not this a highe and an excellent pacience and gentylnes, in ſuche wyſe to ſuffre the weakenes of his electe? And I beſeche you, howe could bee done vnto Thomas a greatter pleaſure? For except he had ſene and felt, he would not haue beleued. And yet was Chriſt ſo good and ſo full of pitie, that Thomas had all his wylle and mynde. For beſydes that he rebuked him with moſt gentle and ſwete woordes, he ſuffered him to put his fynger in his ſyde. O good Lord, what great affection and loue thynkeſt thou dothe he beare
<pb facs="tcp:9767:178"/> to his electe ſeruauntes?

But if thou bee faythfull and beleueſt, &amp; hereafter do not doubt of the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of my reſurrection, then truſt ſurely, that this incredulitee ſhall not in any wyſe hynder or hurte thee, but ſhall ſo and in ſuche maner of wyſe be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen thee, that hereafter I wyll neuer remembre it more. For I require nothyng els for this great benefite, whiche I haue purchaſed for the whole world, through my bitter paſſion, then only a fayth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full heart, whiche ſhall not putte his confidence in no creature, whether it bee in heauen or in yearth, excepte onely in my merites and deſeruyng. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, howe with theſe wordes, thapoſtle is reduced and brought to true fayth.

                  <p>Thirdly, this Goſpel prayſeth and commendeth tranquilitee,<note place="margin">Peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> quietnes and peace of conſcience, and ſheweth likewiſe howe that Chriſt hath communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the ſame to the Apoſtles. And of this peace Chriſt ſpeaketh before his paſſion,<note place="margin">Iho. 14</note> ſaiyng: Peace I leaue with you, my peace I geue vnto you: not as the worlde geueth, geue I vnto you &amp;c. With the whiche wordes Chriſt maketh a difference betwene a ciuile &amp; a chriſtian fayth. The peace of the wolrde lyeth in ciuile and corporal thynges, wherevnto if ryches and goodes chaunce plenteouſly, it maketh menne very negligent and careles, incaſe it bee not prouided and preuented through the word of God. But a chriſtian peace co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in ſpiritual thynges which maketh a man hardy &amp; ſtrong in perſecution and temptacion, and ſuche a one, as when extreme neceſſitee and the honour of God dothe ſo require, they ſhall not onely not fear y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil with the world and all their adherentes, but alſo ſhal diſpiſe them and ſet nothing by them,<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> as we ſee the Apoſtles did after that the holy ghoſt was confirmed in them. Suche a fayth doth Chriſt worke in his ſeruantes, and is apprehended of theim onely, that with a true fayth knowledge &amp; embrace Ieſus Chriſt their lord. And this peace I haue, ſo longe as I beleue in Chriſt. And nowe if I do not beleeue, it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that I can haue any peace in my conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde God for my ſynnes ſake, whiche alwayes
<pb facs="tcp:9767:179"/> accuſeth me in my conſcience, nor wyll not ſuffre me to come nor attaine to this ſpiritual peace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</note> wee fynde here an excellent confeſſion in Thomas, in whiche he knowlegeth Chriſt to bee his God and his Lorde. And this confeſſion is ſo nedefull and neceſſary, without the whiche no man can haue the true righteouſnes that preuaileth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, nor entre into the kyngdome of heauen. But note alſo, howe afore that Chriſte had ſhewed his handes and his feete vnto Thomas, he could not haue this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion.<note place="margin">Handes and fete what it is in ſcri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pture.</note> Handes and feete in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture betokeneth often tymes workes and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacion. Therfore when Chriſt ſheweth vs his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and feete, that is, When he hath brought vs to that point, throught his ſpirite and worde, that we acknowlege his merites, paſſion, death, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all his workes, onely to be the cauſe of our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes and ſaluacion, then may we ſaye with the Apoſtle: My Lorde, my God and put all our truſt in him, accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the ſaiyng of Dauid:<note place="margin">Pſ. 54.</note> Set your truſt in the Lorde, and he ſhall care for you. When Chriſt doth not in ſuche wyſe ſhewe vs his handes and fete, ſo is it for vs vnpoſſible to make any ſuch confeſſion. For ſainct Paule ſayeth not without a cauſe to the Corinthians, ſaiyng:<note place="margin">1. Co. 12</note> No man can ſay that <hi>IESVS</hi> is the Lorde, then through the holy ghoſt. Wherefore it is Chriſte that muſt bryng vs to this confeſſion. Further note, that Thomas beyng enflamed with the holy ghoſt, calleth Chriſt his god. This &amp; ſuch lyke ſentences, by the whiche it is proued that Chriſt is the true &amp; naturall God,
<pb facs="tcp:9767:180"/> ought diligently to bee noted, and ſurely layde vp in our mindes, and eſpecially nowe in this laſt and perilous tyme. Wherfore it is very neceſſary, when ſuche errors &amp; abuſes crepe in (whiche God forbid) that wee bee well inſtructed with this confeſſion of Thomas, leſt wee bee vtterly drawen from the true fayth of Chriſte. With this confeſſion of Thomas, ſainct Ihon in his canonical Epiſtle agreeth very aptely,<note place="margin">1.

He that wyll (theſe admonicions notwithſtandyng) be deceiued, on his perill be it. For we truely (through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> helpe of God) wyll ſtand, liue and dye in this article, in ſuche hope and truſt, that the almightie God of his great mercy &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, will maintayn vs here euerlaſtyngly, through his only ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.

                  <p>IN this Goſpell Chriſt handeleth the Iewes ſomewhat roughly, like as one that almoſt had made an ende of his courſe &amp; runnyng, and nere to his death, ready to be offered vppe: Yea, he reproueth them in ſuche wyſe of their blyndnes, maliciouſnes and their indurate heart, and that with ſo great vehemency and ſo erneſtly, that he could not hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer aſſault them. And that their ingratitude ſhuld be the better knowen vnto them and be brought to light, he reciteth vnto theim the great benefites that God from the beginnyng of the worlde had viſited theim with all, yea, and that whiche was yet commyng before that their great cicie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem ſhould bee deſtroyed: And ſayd howe he ſent theim Prophetes, Wyſemen and Scribes, and euer had ſought all meanes and occaſions to bryng them through their preachyng to ſaluacion, yet al would not helpe.<note place="margin">Prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes.</note> He calleth Prophetes thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:9767:181"/> whiche throughe the inſpiracion of the holy ghoſt, and by the commaundement of God prophecie and teache the people the will of God: And which haue been taught of no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, except of God onely, as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was.<note place="margin">Wyſe men.</note> And he calleth wyſe men thoſe, that haue learned and heard all their wyſdome of other good men, and are ready to vtter it againe to all men, as was Aaron in the olde Teſtament, and ſainct Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin in the newe Teſtament. Scrybes<note place="margin">Scribes</note> he calleth thoſe, whiche not onely throughe preachyng the woorde of God, but alſo through their diligent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in writyng, teache other menne, and profiteth theim highely, as were many after the Apoſtles tyme, and likewyſe in our tyme there be many that haue done muche good in the church of Chriſt, and dayly yet dothe. Of the whiche in another place Chriſt ſayth:<note place="margin">Mat. 13</note> Euery Scribe taught vnto the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, is like an houſholder, which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth furth of his treaſure thynges newe and olde, Out of whiche woordes lightly may bee gathered, the greate benefites that God had ſhewed vpon the Iewes. And how (I pray you) can be ſo wyſe or wel learned that can comprehend with words al the be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefites that god had ſhewed vnto the Iewes, from that tyme that he had brought them out of Egypt, and deliuered them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bondage?<note place="margin">A great benefite to haue the word of God</note> And yet amongſt all other, this was the greateſt &amp; higheſt benefite that he had geuen them his worde, without doubt a moſt precious and excellent gyfte. Whiche gyfte was ſo great,<note place="margin">Rom. 4</note> that as ſainct Paule ſayth, they farre excelled vs Heathen people, foraſmuche as God
<pb facs="tcp:9767:181"/> hadde committed his woorde vnto theim. And the prophete Dauid boaſteth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16</note> that god had doone no ſuche thinge to all nations, lyke as he had done vnto the Iewes. But they ſhewed them ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſo vnthankefull, that it conſtrained god to take awaye that ſame worde from them, as wee ſee in the eight chapiter of the prophet Amos, ſaying: Beholde the tyme commeth, ſayeth the lorde god,<note place="margin">Amos. 8</note> that I ſhall ſende an hunger into the earthe, not the hunger of breade, neither the thruſte of water, but an hunger to heare the worde of the lorde. And the truthe of ſuche a prophecy dothe god ſometyme fulfyl, as in fewe yeares after it did chaunce, when the Iewes were brought into Aſſiria. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And yet neuertheles yt is to bee thoughte a greate grace and benefite, that they were not depryued of the word of god. For they had Moyſes, Aaron, and ſo manye prophetes beſydes, as Saynte Iohn baptiſte, Chriſte himſelfe and the Apoſtels, that Chriſte myghte well reherſe vnto theym: I ſende vnto you Prophetes, wyſe men, and ſcribes. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondarilye, he reproueth theim of theyr cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltye, whiche they vſed agaynſte the Prophetes and other that were ſente vnto theim, receiuinge theym with no reuerence, but moſte abhominably dyd handle theim.

This was a greate blyndenes that the Iewes ſlewe all the Prophetes, and

And in this blyndnes and maliciouſnes they abode and remayned ſtyll in Chriſtes tyme, and long after, and would in no wyſe ſuffre any thyng that ſhould learne theim to amende their blyndnes. But ſo it is wont to go with theim that wyll not harken vnto the worde of God, but abuſe the ſame. Wherfore worthily happeneth vnto them the ſaiyng of Eſaias:<note place="margin">Eſai. 6.</note> Blynde the heart of this people &amp;c. Surely they can not blame Chriſt, ſeyng that the waye of trueth was ſo diligently taught vnto them, before his commyng.

<pb facs="tcp:9767:185"/> he do? Peter had a commaundement of Chriſt to folowe him, and that in his callyng, whiche was before declared vnto him,<note place="margin">Euery manne folowe Chriſt in his callyng.</note> namely in feadyng Chriſt his ſhepe.

For truely, if euery man in his degre would diligently endeuor them ſelfes, to do y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thyng whervnto they are ordained &amp; called of God, and not to ſet ſo litle by it as they do, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out doubt, or ſhould fynd him ſelfe ſo charged, that he ſhould ſone forget to remembre what other men had to do. And take an example:<note place="margin">The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of prechi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g</note> If I am called to the office of preachyng, to be a miniſter of the worde of God, ſo is it very neceſſarye, that I do the ſame with all diligence, in preachyng, readyng, rebukyng com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortyng, and prouidyng for the poore &amp;c. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more it is neceſſarye, that I behaue my ſelfe in all thynges appertainyng to that office, that men may perceiue, that I ſeke none other thyng, but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and vtilitee of the congregacion.</p>
                  <p>Then if I wyll diligently &amp; ſtudiouſly fulfyll this office as here is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement geuen to Peter, and as ſainct Paule in his Epiſtles gloryeth that he hath done,<note place="margin">2.

The lyke manner it is in the office of a good and dylygente father of the houſholde or mother of an houſholde, ſeruaunte or handemayde, that euerye one doo well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre their owne duetye, and faithfullye ſerue and dooe in their vocation, neuer takynge one the others offyce vppon hym, ſeeynge that it ys an vniuſte and a ſinnefull thynge to ſee the matter come to this poynte, that the ſeruaunte ſhoulde take vppon hym the maiſters parte, or the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſeruauntes. And therefore Saynt Paule ſaithe:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7</note> Lette euerye manne continue in that ſame callynge that hee is called vnto.</p>
                  <p>And heere note, that wee ſpeake of that voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that God calleth vs vnto. Neither are the fayned religious menne of oure tyme to be heard, if at this texte they ſeeke a defence for their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure, and ſaye: Thou are called vnto a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall lyfe, therefore needes muſte thou contynue in the Moneſtarye, and lyue a religious lyfe.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9767:186"/>
                  <p>And the cauſe why they are not to be heard, is this. God called theym not to that lyuing, but men: that is, they were brought vnto it by the tradycion of dyuels.</p>
                  <p>Thirdely,<note place="margin">The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtels.</note> in this goſpell is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended and high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly prayſed the auctoritee and office of the Apoſtels, eſpecially againſt thoſe that ſaye: If mannes doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is not to bee receiued, no more is the Apoſtels doctrine, for they were menne alſo. But who euer taught the, or of whom euer haſte thou heard that it is not couenient to heare thoſe men, that teache the truthe and word of god? In this point it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that men vnderſtand well. For when we ſay that the doctrines &amp; tradicions of men are nothing worth in the mattiers of iuſtificacion and faith, we ſpeake nothing of the worde of god whiche is prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched by men, but ſuche doctrine as men haue yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined againſt the worde of god. And ſuerly if oure aduerſaries wold in this matter ſhew and behaue theim ſelues as the Apoſtles did, wee wolde righte gladly receiue them, nothing conſidering that they are but me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And if ye will knowe what the Apoſtels did, herken what is written in this goſpell of Iohn the Euangeliſt, for we wil not now ſpeake of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtels. For Iohn ſaith in this place: This is that ſame diſciple y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beareth witnes of theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; hath writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe things. &amp;c. Hear ye not now wherof Iohn glorifieth? Of the truthe doubtles &amp; that he wrote no lye. Now ſeing he hath written the truth, why ſhuld I not beleue him? Truly I canne not denay, but I ought to receiue a prophete in the name of a prophete. and on the other parte, I am
<pb facs="tcp:9767:187"/> bounde to forſake him that cometh not in the name of a prophet, that is, he that ſpeaketh not the word of god and the truthe. Wherefore if we will that men ſhall receiue and heare vs, go to then, let vs ſpeak and preache the truth of the worde of god, &amp; bring not droſſe for ſyluer,<note place="margin">Eſai. 1.</note> but ſet it forth puerly, &amp; lead not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people into a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence of their owne wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes, but bring them vnto Chriſt. Let vs folowe the Apoſtles in the office of preachinge, eſpecially S.

                  <p>And firſt the Euangeliſt deſcribeth in this place howe Mary, Ioſeph &amp; the childe fled into Egypte:<note place="margin">Chriſte fleeth into Egypt.</note> Which doubtles was a great ſorowe to Mary and Ioſeph: yea ſuche a croſſe, as day and night tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented them.

But in this God would declare, that the kyngdome of his beloued ſonne is not of this worlde, and that he muſt entre into his glorye and kyngdome through many perſecutions, and muche trouble. Yea,<note place="margin">Iohn 18 Luc. 22.</note> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore it declareth that all ſuche as depende vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and repoſe their whole hope in him, ſhall haue none other fortune in this worlde, then Chriſt him ſelfe had. And here note the profound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God. Chriſt beyng the beloued ſonne of
<pb facs="tcp:9767:188"/> the father, with Ioſephe and his louyng mother Mary, muſt needes flee and geue place to Herode, a moſt wretched caytife and cruel tyrant: Where as yet God might (yea with one woorde of his mouth) haue deſtroyed him, and puniſhed him accordyng to his demerites. Why was this done? Doubtleſſe, foraſmuche as Chriſt was geuen into this worlde to dye for vs, and to ſuffre al maner of euils, it was neceſſary that ſome profe of it ſhuld be now ſhewed in his childhod.<note place="margin">Oſee. 11</note> And furthermore, it was neceſſary to fulfyll the prophecie of Oſeas ſaiynge. Out of Egypte I haue called my ſonne. And alſo Herode himſelf (as yet) had not fulfilled the meaſure of his fury, And needes muſt he dayly more &amp; more heape the wrath and indignacion of God vpon him ſelfe. For wretchedly he lyued all his life, therefore he wretchedly dyed. He cruelly executed the tyraunts parte, wherefore he had the rewarde of a tyraunt. And ſuche is the fortune of Chriſtians, that theyr enemyes doo lyue a mooſte pleaſaunt lyfe and are exalted as hygh as the Cedre trees of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high moun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tains of Lybane,<note place="margin">Pſal. 36</note> but the Chriſtians ar oppreſſed &amp; troden vnder foote, as you ſee here, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it chaunced, to Chriſt himſelfe, to Mary his bleſſed mother, and to Ioſeph.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9767:188"/> And this doth he by a noble meſſanger. that is to ſaye, an angell. Beſides this, where as Ieſus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes were poore folkes and had ſmall comforte, either of kinneſmen, or of theyr neyghboures, yet god ſo looketh vnto theym, that the wyſe men came frome the Eaſte countreies, bringinge theim gyftes, wherewith they might ſuſtaine both them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues, and the babe, vntyll the tyrannous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltye of Herode were ceaſed, and at an ende.</p>
                  <p>Nowe, althoughe god layde a very heauye croſſe vppon Marye, Ioſeph, and the babe Ieſus, yet withdrewe he not frome them his fatherly mynde, but cheriſſhed theim with ſuche goodneſſe and mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cye, that althoughe they were in tribulacion, yet they periſhed not, but were fortunately delyuered, euen as god hathe promiſed vnto all chriſtians, that ſuffre tribulacion for his woorde.</p>

                  <p>Thyrdly the Euangeliſt deſcribeth the crueltie and tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny of Herode.

And forbicauſe he dyd aſke lyke a iuſtifier that wolde be iuſtifed by his owne workes without fayth, therefore he receaueth ſuche an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere as concernyng workes. This ioyly felow by and by boaſteth and rufleth out (as the faſhion of iuſtifiers alwayes is for to do) and proudely anſwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red of his works which he had done, and ſayth: All theſe haue I kepte from my youth vp, What lacke I yet?<note place="margin">Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are boaſters of their workes.</note> What ſhall we ſay or think of thys vaine and proude confidence? Peraduenture he ſhuld not haue had anſwered much amyſſe, yf the law had not
<pb facs="tcp:9767:191"/> been ſpiritual (as ſainct Paule ſayth) and had not required the affection of the heart and the inwarde man, and not only the outward apparance of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,<note place="margin">workes.</note> wherin this iuſtifier was deceiued. Nowe for-becauſe that he ſhould learne to knowe his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and hypocriſy, Chriſt ſayth vnto him: One thyng ye wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. If thou wilt be perfect, go thy way &amp; ſel that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt, and geue it vnto the poore. Here was ſodenly a wyndow opened into his heart, ſo that he might haue ſene, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what a feble &amp; weake founda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion &amp; imperfect fayth he ſtode.

It is eaſier (ſayth he) for Camel to go thorowe the eye of a nedle, than for a riche ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to entre into the kyngdom of heauen &amp;c. Whiche thynges when S.

It ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be denied but that S. Peter with his brother Andrew, frely &amp; voluntarily did leaue &amp; forſoke al (although it was but litle) &amp; folowed Chriſt. And ſurely, if Peter had been ſo riche as euer was Creſus, yet when he had heard Chriſt ſpeake in his hart this ſaiyng, Folow me.<note place="margin">A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was in Peter</note> he would haue left al &amp; folowed him.

And as
<pb facs="tcp:9767:191"/> touchi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g this matter, it ſemeth that Peter was like vnto thoſe workmen, which when thei were agreed for their wages, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vyneyard, but yet requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a greater reward, then thei that came about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ix. and xi. hour. For when did Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (I pray you) require any ſuch thyng when he was commaunded of God to forſake his fathers houſe and folowe the Lorde into a ſtrange lande? Therfore Peter is ſet furth in this place as an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of mans infirmitee which notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng,<note place="margin">Peter s fayth of Chriſt.</note> Chriſt (accordyng to his ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Yea if that good &amp; moſt bountiful Chriſt ſhould reiect &amp; caſt away all them whiche were weake in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayth, what ſhould become of vs I beſeche you? There is not one of vs whiche would not gladly take a reward, though he had not deſerued the ſame by any maner of ſeruice. Beſides that, all wee with good wyll would raigne with Chriſt, though we haue neueer ſuffered any thyng with him or for him. But loke not, that that ſhal ſo come to paſſe, but thus it ſhalbe, He that ſuffereth with me, ſhall alſo raigne with me.</p>
                  <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>darily, though it be mete and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do our dutie &amp; ſeruice vnto God of very loue of the heart, without any reſpect of reward (for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhal folowe of his owne accorde) yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtandyng Chriſt ſheweth vnto Peter &amp; to the other Apoſtles, how he will intreate them, and what they ſhal at length receiue of him. And this his promiſe
<pb facs="tcp:9767:192"/> he alſo confirmeth with an othe, ſaiyng: Verely I ſay vnto you, that when the ſonne of man ſhal ſit in the ſeate of his Maieſtie, ye whiche haue folowed me in the newe byrth, ſhall ſyt alſo vpon the twelue ſeates, and iudge the twelue tribes of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Heare howe large a promyſe is made in this place vnto the Apoſtles. For he wyll not onely conferre this benefite vnto theim, (although a greater can not be deſired) that by him they ſhall be made good and righteous,<note place="margin">The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtles.</note> and (if they perſeuer vnto the ende in a true fayth) partakers alſo of euerlaſtyng life, by his only grace and mercy: but alſo he wyll make them iudges, that in the newe byrthe, when we ſhal be receiued into euerlaſtyng health, they ſhall ſitte nere vnto Chriſt. Of the whiche iudgement ſainct Paule alſo ſpeaketh:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6</note> Do ye not knowe (ſayth he) that we ſhall iudge Angelles. Albeit wee muſt not referre this iudgement to the laſt iudgement only, but it muſt alſo be vnderſtanded of the laſte iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſpirit among chriſtians in this life. For aſſone as by the worde wee receiue the holy ghoſt, &amp; and are made the ſons of God through fayth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this gyfte geuen vs alſo, that by the worde we may iudge al thynges, euen as ſainct Paule wytneſſeth in another place. The ſpiiritual man iudgeth all thynges,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2</note> and he is iudged of no man. And Chriſt alſo: Nowe is come the iudgement of this worlde, and the prince of this worlde ſhalbe thruſt out. Are not the thynges, which are promiſed vnto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in this place, great and excellent? And it is to be vnderſtand that to leaue all thynges, &amp; to folow Chriſt, muſt be done at the fyrſt. For although the
<pb facs="tcp:9767:192"/> Apoſtles had left all thynges and folowed Chriſte when he ſpake theſe woordes, yet was fayth at that tyme vnperfect in them. Moreouer the holy ghoſt was not yet confirmed in them, as it came to paſſe afterwarde vpon the day of Pentecoſt. Yea, euen Chriſte himſelfe affirmeth, that they lefte all thynges vnperfectly, &amp; folowed him, when he ſayth that he ſent furth his diſciples without ſtaffe and ſcrippe, &amp; yet they lacked nothyng. And in another place. The children of the ſpouſe faſt not, whiles the ſpouſe is with them. The Apoſtles in very dede folowed Chriſt,<note place="margin">He that beleueth is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in tyme of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.</note> &amp; were ſent furth to preache in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But where was perſecution? yea, rather where was fayth, whiche could haue borne ſuche perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion if it had happened? Wherfore it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtand, that the Apoſtles left all thynges, &amp; folowed Chriſt perfectly then, &amp; not before, when vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dai of Pentecoſt, they did with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant mynde confeſſe Chriſt before the Scribes &amp; Phariſeis, and all the people. Moreouer, when they preached not only in Iurye, but in all the worlde vnto the people with ſuche ſedulitee, diligence and conſtancy, that at laſt they wer alſo compelled to dye for preachyng of the Goſpel.<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of ſainct Paule.</note> And truely as concernyng this matter of folowyng Chriſt, ſainct Paule, whoſe feaſt wee celebrate this day, is not to be counted the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>For after that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted of God (as we reade in the nynth chapiter of the Actes of the Apoſtles) and of a Wolfe was made a ſhepe, he preached his Lorde Chriſt with ſuche zeale and earneſt affection of mynde, that euen at this day his voyce is heard of this matter, and that not in one place onely, but
<pb facs="tcp:9767:193"/> throughout all the whole worlde. The almightie God graunt that we may receiue his doctrine and direct our life accordyng to the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdly, foraſmuche as Chriſte hath promiſed vnto his Apoſtles, iudgement ouer the xii. tribes of Iſrael, becauſe that in his name they left all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; folowed him: Nowe he procedeth to declare further, what he wyll geue to all thoſe that for his names ſake ſhall loſe any thyng,<note place="margin">Reward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of it ſelf</note> and ſayth. Euery one that forſaketh houſe, or brethren or ſyſters, or father or mother, or wyfe or children, or landes for my names ſake, ſhal receiue an hundreth folde, and the inheritance of euerlaſtyng life. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyll referre the former promiſe only to the Apoſtles, let him know, that this promiſe is ſpoken ſo plainly to all chriſtians generally, that it muſt nedes remayne a general truth. Only let vs marke this well, howe it muſt be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to leaue all things, &amp; to folow Chriſt. For to do this truly &amp; vnfaynedly, doubtles is required a true fayth. yea, if I haue a true fayth, whiche is dead vnto all creatures, and liueth vnto Chriſt alone &amp; vnto righteouſnes, then haue I left all thinges in my heart,<note place="margin">To leue and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all.</note> although by the good will of God I may chriſtianly &amp; godly vſe &amp; enioye my goodes ſo long as I liue: yet neuertheleſſe I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies redy, if nede be, to leaue al thinges &amp; willyng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to folow Chriſt, yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto death, hauyng this hope &amp; aſſured truſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it pleaſeth God that it be ſo, &amp; that he requireth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame of me.

                     <pb facs="tcp:9767:193"/> in that other lyfe, I ſhall receiue euerlaſtynge life. For Chriſt, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth it ſelfe, in no wyſe doth lye, but without dout dothe performe this promiſe with me. But in this place it ſhal be expedient that we doo rightly vnderſtand, what it is to receiue an hundreth folde.<note place="margin">The er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baptiſts</note> For the Anabaptiſtes go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute hereof to proue a corporall kingedome of Chriſte, and a ſuer and quiete lyfe, which the chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtians muſte inioye a thouſand yeares after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the deade, all the wycked and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being deſtroyed.

No,<note place="margin">To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth folde.</note> not ſo.

<pb facs="tcp:9767:201"/> ſo deſirouſly wayted for. And the euangelyſt Luke with very great dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce meruailous plainly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beth that glad tidinges. For he right diligently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuſſeth al the circumſtances of it, and in as good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ordre as maye bee recyted them.</p>
                  <p>Fyrſt he ſheweth the tyme,<note place="margin">The tyme.</note> that is, the ſyxte, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Elizabeth wyfe to Zachary the prieſt, had conceiued Iohn the baptiſt. And then further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,<note place="margin">Gabiel,</note> hee nameth alſo the aungell, by that name that was knowen and excellente in the ſcriptures: as in Daniell the 8. and 9. chapiter: And this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell alſo was before ſent vnto Zachary. Thirdely, he ſheweth who ſent that angell,<note place="margin">Who ſent him</note> that is god, which longe before had ordained Marye vnto this glory that ſhe ſhuld be the mother vnto his ſon. Fourthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye alſo you ſe, whether and to whome the Aungell was ſente: that is, into a toune of Galile, named Nazareth,<note place="margin">The city The huſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bande. The vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyne.</note> vnto a virgine deſpouſed vnto a manne called Ioſeph, of the houſe of Dauid. And the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines name was Mary. Now if a man will declare theſe circumſtances, and accordinge to their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie diſcuſſe them, it can not be opened what dignity and ornament theſe ſhal adde vnto the annuncion.</p>
                  <p>And nowe conſidre after what manner this annunciation came to paſſe, and how we ſhuld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. The aungell cometh vnto Mary, and very gentely ſaluteth her, as a virgine repleniſhed with grace, with whome the Lorde is: and whiche ſhuld in tyme comming, be bleſſed aboue al women, bicauſe of thoſe excellent giftes, which god woulde giue vnto her. And in as much as ſhe was abaſhed or troubled, bycauſe of his woordes, therefore the
<pb facs="tcp:9767:201"/> Angel continueth his wordes, and ſayth: Mary, be not afrayde, doubtleſſe thou haſt found grace with God. Behold thou ſhalt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue in thy wombe and beare a ſonne, and ſhalt call his name Ieſus. Here it is neceſſary that wee conſider well two thynges. Fyrſt, that Mary founde ſo great grace with God.<note place="margin">Two thynges noted.</note> For that which is founde, ſurely it is founde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any merites of any woorkes that went before, and ſo it commeth vnloked for.<note place="margin">To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme grace is not to merite or deſerue.</note> Then if Mary found ſuche grace afore God, I beſeche you where are they, that ſay ſhe deſerued it? And therevpon doo make an Idoll of her, ſettyng it aboue God. I can well beare, and truely ſo is it worthy, that Mary be praiſed, and exalted as a goodly virgyn, and full of grace afore God, yea, and alſo to be ſet furth vnto all chriſtians, as a liuely enſample of fayth. yet (that notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng) ſuffre her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a creature that attayned vnto that dignitee, by grace without merites, and that neuer deſired to be extolled aboue her ſonne, as ye may wel perceiue by her owne woordes, where ſhe ſayth in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: Whatſoeuer my ſonne ſhall ſay vnto you, that do.<note place="margin">Iohn. 2</note> Doth not this mooſte bleſſed virgyn Mary in this place ſende men from her ſelfe vnto Chriſt, and vnto his woorde? Surely wee confeſſe, that Mary obtayned of God greatter fauour or grace, then all other women, in that ſhe was full of the holy ghoſt, and the Lorde was with her. But nowe it foloweth not of this, that I ſhuld make an Idol of her, that we ſhuld eſteme her to be our life, ſwete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; al our hope, as doth that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticle <hi>Salue regina,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9767:202"/> but rather it were more right, to ſpeake theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Chriſt, whiche ſayth. I, I, I am the way, the truth &amp; life. The other thyng, that we here thynke worthy to be noted is this. We muſt dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly way, what the Angel ſayd vnto Mari. Behold (ſayd he) thou ſhalt conceiue in thy wombe and beare a ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. For theſe woordes pertayne vnto the humanitee of Chriſt, whiche in oure tyme is impugned, without ſhame,<note place="margin">The ana<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baptiſts errour.</note> of the Anabaptiſtes. For they confeſſe, that he receiued of Mary in her wombe, figure, forme &amp; nutrimentes. But this they beleue not, that he toke any thyng of fleſhe and bloud of Mary. But this text teacheth plainly that doubtles Chriſt fyrſt was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued of the holy ghoſt, &amp; then by the operacion of the ſame holy ghoſt, he receiued (as euery other childe doth) forme, figure, &amp; nouriſhementes, fleſhe and bloud of his mother the virgyn Mary, and ſo was borne of her as the article of oure fayth decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. And we by the aſſiſtance of Goddes grace ſhal euer continue in this fayth and confeſſe it, &amp; neuer depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, though the Anabaptiſtes waxe neuer ſo wodde, and bable neuer ſo muche vayne wordes in waſte.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, in this Goſpel is excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the kyngdome of Chriſte.<note place="margin">The kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſte.</note> For the Angel ſayth: And the Lord God ſhall geue vnto him the ſeate of Dauid his father, and he ſhall reigne ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe of Iacob eternally: and there ſhalbe no ende of his kyngdome. In theſe woordes Chriſt is called the ſonne of Dauid, &amp; I thynke becauſe he was ſo long before promiſed to Dauid, and that he toke fleſhe &amp; bloud of Mary,<note place="margin">Dauids ſeate.</note> whiche was of the ſeade of Dauid.
<pb facs="tcp:9767:202"/> And this ſeate or maieſtie of Dauid, whiche ſhould be geuen vnto him, is no corporal ſeate, but a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſeate. For if it were a corporal ſeat, it could not endure for euer, but it muſt needes haue an ende.</p>
                  <p>And therfore the Angel added: And his kyngdome ſhall haue none ende. Suche a kyngdome of Chriſt is alſo excellently deſcribed by the Prophete Eſaie in the ix. chapiter, where among other thynges he ſayth thus:<note place="margin">Eſai. 9.</note> His imperie ſhalbe dilated or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and peace ſhalbe without end vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the throne of Dauid, &amp; vpon his kyngdome, that he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme &amp; ſtrengthen it, in iuſtice and iudgement, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thencefurth and for euermore. Marke, that ſuche a peace ſhalbe in the kyngdome of Chriſte, whiche ſhal not endure for a tyme, but for euermore. And how could this peace be referred vnto Dauid, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che neither had this peace, nor yet could geue it vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to other? Furthermore, in this kyngdome iuſtice ſhalbe made ſtrong in iudgement.<note place="margin">Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente.</note> Nowe, howe ſhall this be? Where as is no knowlege of ſynnes, there can not folowe the iuſtice of fayth. Therfore that I may come vnto the knowlege of ſynne, and after that, by fayth attayn vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes of fayth, Chriſt fyrſt cauſeth me, ſo to be throwe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doune at the preachyng of repentaunce, that I ſhall feale my ſelfe worthy for my ſynnes to haue hell and eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal dampnacion. But then through the preachyng of free remiſſion of ſynnes for Chriſtes ſake, I ſhal be againe comforted, and rayſed vp, ſo that in tyme commyng I ſhall feare nothyng for my ſynnes, but I ſhal ſtand ſtedfaſt in fayth, and wayte for eternal health. After this maner is iuſtice ſtabliſhed by
<pb facs="tcp:9767:203"/> iudgement in the kyngdome of Chriſt. Vpon this againe it foloweth, that this ſeate of Dauid, which here is promiſed vnto Chriſt, is nothyng els but a ſpiritual kyngdome of Chriſt, whiche is gouerned and ruled by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture of the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gely, or goſpell. Neither can it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in any maner other thyng, then in ſpirite and trueth. For it can not bee a corporall kyngdome. For why, theſe thynges that wee haue nowe ſpoken of, and the corporal kyngdome that Dauid ſometyme gouerned, differre as farre as heauen and yerth. And to ſpeake briefly, Chriſt him ſelfe in the goſpel of Luke concludeth this, ſaiyng: The kyngdome of God is within you.<note place="margin">Luc. 17</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thyrdly, wee haue here a noble enſample of true fayth in Mary. For although at the fyrſt ſhe was abaſhed at the Angels worde, and afterwarde alſo wondered right ſore,<note place="margin">Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of fayth in Mari</note> howe ſhe ſhould be the mother of the Lord, ſeyng that ſhe knewe no man: Yet now when ſhe heareth, that the holy ghoſt ſhould worke all this in her, ſhe gladly committeth her ſelfe vnto the wylle of God, with great mekenes &amp; lowlynes, and beleueth the Angel whiche God had ſent vnto her. Wherfore alſo Elizabeth highly praiſed this fayth,<note place="margin">Luc. 1.</note> ſaiyng: Bleſſed art thou which haſt beleued, for thoſe thynges ſhalbe acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed in thee, which were tolde thee from the Lord.<note place="margin">Nature of fayth</note> For this is the true nature of fayth, which appeareth here in Mary, to beleueue the worde, to leane vnto the worde, and to cleaue vnto the worde, yea though that thyng whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the worde ſpeaketh of, can in no wiſe be compre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by mans reaſon. For why ſhuld it bee called fayth, but that it beleueth thynges inuiſible &amp; not
<pb facs="tcp:9767:203"/> appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yea, &amp; inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Thus did Abra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto hope, he beleued i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to hope. For as S. Paul ſaith: He was not weake in faith, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered his own body, dead in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, (for he was now almoſt an hundreth yeare old) nor the ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raine wombe of Sarah. He ſtaggered not thorow vnbeliefe at the promiſe of god, but he was ſtronge in faith, and gaue to god the honoure, ful certefyed, that whatſoeuer god promiſed, he was able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. Inlike manner muſt we do. Whenſoeuer god ſpeaketh any thing whiche I can not obtaine nor perceiue by my reaſon or wiſedome, it becometh me not to diſpute, by what meanes it maye come to paſſe, but thus muſte I ſaye: Behold, I am ready the lordes bonde ſeruaunt, and gladly do I meeke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſubmitte my ſelfe captiue vnto thy woorde, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thouge I perceiue it not, nor can not comprehende it. Thus did Mary, when the aungell had ſaide: The holy ghoſt ſhall come ouer the, and the power of the moſte higheſt, ſhall ouerſhadowe the. &amp;c. Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye ſayd: Beholde the Lordes hande mayden, be it done to me, accordynge to thy woorde. Nowe if yee will doo vnto Marye ſuche ſeruice as ſhall pleaſe her, beeleue the promiſe of god as ſhee beleued it. Feare god, as Mary feared god, liue as ſhee liued, and thou ſhalt poſſeſſe eternall lyfe as Marye doth. As Chriſte promiſed: Who ſo euer doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil of my father that is in heauen, he is my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſiſter and mother. God graunte vs all that wee maye doo well. Amen.</p>

                     <p>The beginninge of this goſpell declareth with how greate humanitie and gentlenes Chriſt prouo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked Iudas vnto repentaunce, adding alſo vnto yt,<note place="margin">Chriſts pacience calleeth Iudas to repen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taunce.</note> that except he did repent, that da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nacion in ſoul and bodye was prophecied to chaunce vnto hym. But who tolde Chriſt that Iudas ſhuld betray him, and deliuer him into the handes of the Iewes? Surely no man. But he beinge very god, that ſearcheth the hertes &amp; raines of al men, knew it, neither nedeth he any man to ſhewe him ſuche things. Now that hys clemency, goodnes, &amp; long ſuffering in all thinges might appeare, therfore he handleth him that ſhuld betray him, with ſuch mercy &amp; friendly or familiare dealing, &amp; calleth him vnto penance after that faſhi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on that he vtereth him not by name, but onlye with his worde toucheth his conſcience.

                     <p>And leſt we ſhould forget the ſame, he ordayned not a yerely memorye (as the Paſchal Lambe was eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but ones euery yere) out a dayly remembrance he ordained therof in bread &amp; wyne ſanctified &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to that purpoſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 26</note> ſaiyng: This is my body: This cuppe is my bloud, whiche is ſhed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſynnes.

                     <pb facs="tcp:9767:206"/>
                     <p>For as in the olde teſtament God ſayd:<note place="margin">Exo. 12.</note> This is the Lordes Paſſeby, or Paſſeouer, euen ſo ſayth Chriſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> newe teſtament, This is my body:<note place="margin">Ma. 26</note> This is my bloud. But in the old miſtery and ſacrament, the Lambe was not the Lordes very Paſſeouer or paſſyng by, but it was a figure whiche repreſented his paſſyng by. So likewiſe in the newe teſtament, the bread and wyne bee not Chriſtes very body and bloud, but they be figures, whiche by Chriſtes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitucion bee vnto the godly receiuers therof, ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes, tokens, ſignificacions, and repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tacions of his very fleſhe &amp; bloud inſtructyng their fayth, that as the bread and wyne feede theim corporally, and continue this temporal life: ſo the very fleſhe &amp; bloud of Chriſt feedeth theim ſpiritually, &amp; geueth them euerlaſtyng life. For vnto the faythful Chriſt is at his owne holy table preſent, with his mightie ſpirite and grace, and is of them more fruitfully re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyued, than if corporally they ſhould receiue him bodily preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

He that prepared the table is Chriſt himſelfe. The meate and drynke wherewith he fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth theim that come thereto as they ought do, is his owne very fleſhe and bloud.</p>
                     <p>They that come thereto, muſte occupye their myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in conſideryng howe his bodye was broken for them, and his bloud ſhed for their redempcion, and

                     <p>Fourthly, it is neceſſary that we knowe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto this ſacrament profiteth, and what vtilitee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth to vs by it, and what is the power of it.

This ſame ſpiritual eatyng and drinkyng of the ſayd body and bloud of Chriſt, is not receiued in the mouthe, &amp; digeſted in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, but it is receyued with a pure heart &amp; a ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere fayth, beleuyng that Chriſte gaue his body to death &amp; ſhed his bloud vpon the croſſe for vs, &amp; that he doth ſo ioyne and incorporate himſelf to vs, that he is our heade, and we his membres, hauyng him dwellyng in vs, &amp; wee in him.

Suppoſe you there bee any ryches in this worlde lyke vnto this? Naye verely. Why ſo? For the goodes of this worlde, be they neuer ſo excellent, neuer ſo precious &amp; great in value, neuer ſo pleaſant &amp; beautifull, yet they ebbe &amp; flowe, they fall as leaues, and thei paſſe away, although in this life onely they comfort man much, yea, and rather vexe &amp; trouble him: But this treaſure of forgeuenes of ſynnes, when by fayth it

Wherefore yt is very neceſſarye, that we with al diligence and ſtudiouſe mind, ſerch for this treaſure. There ar ſome that are ſo minded that they thinke that when they haue the worde, it is not verye neceſſary nor maketh no great matter whether they come vnto the ſacrament or no, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is in their liberty whether they wyll take part of the lords table or no.<note place="margin">All men ar bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> But I deny that liberty, &amp; lai, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are ſo ſore bound to remembre this benefite receiued of God through Chriſt, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtels wer, and often to reuolue it in heart and to giue thanks for it. For though I neither can, nor will bynd me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto a certaine preſcript, or peculier time to receiue this ſacrament, yet it is neceſſarye, that wee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the commaundement of Chriſte, and that often<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tymes we accompliſhe and in deede fulfyll it. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, it is a trewth and can not bee denied, but that by the woorde, there is offered vnto vs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes. And in the ſame worde is this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament commaunded and comprehended, ſo that the one can not bee in onye wiſe deuided frome the other.</p>

Ther is a promiſe in the lordes ſupper, that Chriſt wold giue his owne body vnto death for vs, &amp; that he wold ſhed his blud, to waſh away our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And in this promiſe there is no douting. But
<pb facs="tcp:9767:208"/> what profiteth this promiſe vnto me, excepte I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue &amp; take hold vpon it by faith? But yet if I wil be partaker of theſe thinges, it is neceſſary that I come in faith. For euery promiſe of God is receiued by faith.

Al theſe ſentences ar ſpoken of faith. Now who ſo cometh vnto the communion of the lordes ſupper not hauing this faithe, then not only hee eateth it not vnto his health and eternall life, but muche rather he taketh part of this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto eternal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as S.

                     <p>Furthermore, this ſacrament ſhuld moue &amp; ſtir vs to friendſhip, to liue quietly in peace, vnitie &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, &amp; to put away all hatred, variance &amp; diſcord. &amp; to teſtifie a brotherly &amp; vnfained loue betwene vs. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be made al partakers of this one table what ought we to thinke, but that we be al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres of one ſpiritual body? that we be ioyned togither in one Chriſte, as a greate numbre of graines of corne bee ioyned togither in one lofe.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9767:209"/>
                     <p>Wherefore they that can not bee perſuaded to bee good to their chriſtian brethren (for whome Chriſt ſuffered death) when in this ſacrament they be put in remembraunce, that the ſonne of god beſtowed his lyfe for his enemyes.

Chriſt toke this ſtrype paciently, as the ſcripture ſayth: When he was rayſed vpon, he dyd not geue euil woordes agayne. When he was euil intreated, he did not thret them. Yet could not hee approue that their iniuſt delyng, as a thyng well done. And euen ſo it is expedient for euerye chriſtian manne to do, that is, he ought doubtleſſe freely to confeſſe the trueth before the worlde and all men, as did the Prophetes, ſainct Ihon Baptiſt, Chriſt himſelfe and the Apoſtles, and as al the elect ſynce the beginnyng of the worlde haue done.

                     <p>Thyrdly, wee haue nowe the fall of ſainct Peter,<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſumpci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and raſhnes of fleſhe</note> whom we ought diligently to conſider and marke. For we not only beholde in him, how fooliſh, raſhe and vnwiſe the preſumption of man is, but alſo we learne in him, that when a manne hath by frailtye
<pb facs="tcp:9767:217"/> fallen, he ſhulde not by and by diſpaire, but muche rather looke vnto the goodneſſe and clemencye of Chriſte, by the which Peter was againe receiued, &amp; obtained remiſſion of all his ſinnes. Doubteles, it was a greate preſumption that hee promiſed to go with Chriſt, euen vnto the very death, and by this preſumtion fel he into ſo great ſinne. For how ſhuld fleſhe wiſhe for death, ſeing that very nature hathe ſo diſpoſed the fleſh, that ſhe rather deſireth a quiet and pleaſant liuinge? For euen he that is indued with the holye ghoſt, hath much a do to take heed, leaſt in death he be ouercome or diſpair: much leſſe may we thinke, that of our owne ſtrength we maye be able to ſtande againſte it. Wherefore we oughte to be very circumſpecte and ware, that we preſume not, but that we ſtand in fear euermore. yet for all that, contynually beſeching god the father, that he will voutchſafe for his ſonne Chriſtes ſake, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte vs with his holy ſpirite, that we be ouercome in no temptacion, but that euermore wee maye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and feele his helpe, ſtrength and conſolacion.

For ſurely Chriſte hath euen now the ſame mynd,<note place="margin">Anabap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſtes er<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>roure.</note> that he had then, when he receiued Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againe into his fauoure.

But ſett their foliſhe bablyng light, for they bee vayne, and vayne they continue.

And of this place mayſt thou learne, howe great ieopardy it is to preachers of the woorde of God, often to vſe the courtes of great men of the worlde: and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for theſe conſideracions.

Then furthermore, Sathan him ſelfe alſo is very ready, &amp; our fleſhe is exceadyng weake, ſo that without doubt here needeth great careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſtudious hede to be taken. But what ſhal the preacher of Gods truth do here? Forſoth thus. He may not haue to great loue vnto the courtly daintie fare, nor to muche acquaint himſelfe with thoſe whiche in the court do ſeke none other thyng but voluptuous pleaſures, honor, porte, &amp; in ſuche thynges haue their heauen, but he ought diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remembre his office, and geue all his care and ſtudye, well to rule with the ſworde of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinually to whet that vpon theim.

                     <p>Thirdly, we haue here deſcribed, who they were that buried Chriſt, &amp; with what reuerence his dead body was brought vnto the earth.

                     <p>For that they here do, it cometh of an imperfecte faith, for they were yet far from the perfection that Paul ſpeaketh of,<note place="margin">Rom. 1</note> ſaying: I am not aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of god vnto ſal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uacion, to euery man that beleueth.

For as it chaunſed to theſe, euen ſo chaunſed it to diuers other, as wee may read in this hiſtory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrection of Chriſt. Neither was it poſſible, that this article of Chriſtes reſurrection ſhuld be perceiued or beleued, without great difficultee: yea, &amp; that they might apprehend it,<note place="margin">Chriſt ſerueth our infir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitee.</note> Chriſte was in a maner co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to ſerue them in wordes, dedes, miracles &amp; the angels. Furthermore in ſhewyng his woundes, and yet for all this verye hardely could they be perſuaded in this article of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrection. So peruerſe is the fleſhe, and ſo ful of euil, if it be not by the ſpirit of God illuminate and brought to the knowlege of God. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng there remayned yet in theſe two, certaine ſmal ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of loue towarde Chriſt, ſo that they muſt nedes talke of Chriſt, and the one open his grief vnto the other. And when they thus do, Chriſt gladly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto them, and as a ſtraunger iournyeth with them, ſaluteth them, and aſketh the cauſe of their co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>municacion and reaſonyng, and why they were ſo ſorowful. Wherein we haue a leſſon, that Chriſte
<pb facs="tcp:9767:234"/> hath a meruaylous delite in deuout, godly &amp; chriſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an communyng or talkyng,<note place="margin">Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> talking.

It is to be wyſhed, that this leſſon were dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly inculcate in mennes memorye. For truely menne are to nothyng ſo muche enclyned, as vnto euil talkyng, detraction and filthye communicacion: ſo that a manne maye fynde more honeſty and nurture in the talkyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heathen &amp; vnchriſtened, then among thoſe that boſt them ſelues of Chriſtes name, nothyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideryng nor regardyng,<note place="margin">Mat. 12</note> that of euery idle woorde wee muſt geue accompt in the day of iudgement:<note place="margin">Ephe. 4</note> nor yet pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deryng, that S.

Talke of thoſe thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that pertayne to the honour of God, and thyne owne ſaluacion. Let thy wyll and ſtudye be euer in the law of God, and ſo ſhal Chriſt not be farre from thee. But if in thy talkyng thou forget God, then looke not for God, but for the deuil to bee preſente with thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, we haue here alſo what Chriſt did when he was come into the companye of theſe two diſciples. And fyrſt he maketh himſelf ſo, as though he knewe nothyng, nor had heard what was doone in Ieruſalem in thoſe dayes. And this dothe he to drawe furth their incredulitee, and to rebuke theim
<pb facs="tcp:9767:234"/> for it, and to haue occaſion to inſtructe them, as he dyd after warde. And they by and by plainly decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red theyr myndes, ſo talkyng of Chriſte, that a man may eaſely perceyue, that as concernyng him, his worde and promiſes, though they had not vtterly, yet for the moſt part, they wer fallen into diſpayre. Beſydes this, though they acknowleged him to be a Prophete, mightie in woordes and deedes before God, yet nowe they thought theyr hope fruſtrate,<note place="margin">Chriſt wyll not caſt vs a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>way for our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Rom. 7</note> that he ſhould redeme Iſrael. But what dothe Chriſte? Chriſte our Lorde knoweth very well and perfectly what is oure infirmitee and incredulitee, neither is he ignorant that no good thing is in our fleſhe. Wherfore, although wee bee vnperfecte in fayth, yet wyll not he caſt vs away, but rebuke and teache vs, as he dothe here the diſciples, teachyng vs by his owne enſample, to do likewyſe. And fyrſt he correcteth vs, and ſayeth: O fooles and harde hearted, to beleue in all thynges that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophetes haue ſpoken. Muſt not Chriſt ſuffre theſe thynges, and ſo entre into his glorye? It is neither vnright nor crueltie, that he here calleth his diſciples foles, whiche yet he forbad Mathew .v.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> For that he here doth, he doth it of a godly zeale and fatherly loue, and ſo alſo may any manne do likewyſe, eſpecially when theyr heart nor mynde be none otherwyſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte, then was Chriſt towarde his diſciples.</p>
                  <p>Then beganne he at Moſes and all the prophetes, and interpreted to theim in all their writynges, ſuche places as were written of him. It is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rebuke onely, and not to comfort againe. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore he that ſhall rebuke another man, ought
<pb facs="tcp:9767:235"/> not onely to recite to his rebuke, what he had done vnrightfully, but he muſt alſo ſhewe what he hath done honeſtly, vertuouſly, and alſo profitably: Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo doth Chriſt here. Fyrſt he rebuketh their incre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dulitee or vnfaythfulnes. Then foraſmuche as fayth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of hearing of the worde, he proueth &amp; alloweth their ſaiyng out of the deuine ſcriptures, that Chriſt muſt ſuffre. And walkyng with them he earneſtly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſuche maieſtie &amp; power, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſciples after wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege it &amp; ſay: Dyd not oure heart burne in vs, when he talked with vs in the way, and opened to vs the ſcriptures? O bleſſed is that man, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt thus draweth by his woorde, and whiche is by Chriſtes ſpirit inſtruct into the true knowlege of God.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdly, the Euangeliſt deſcribeth after what maner Chriſt ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſhewed himſelfe to theſe his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, &amp; opened theyr eyes, ſaiyng: And they drewe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye vnto the toune whether thei went, and he made as though he would go further. And they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled him &amp; ſayd: Tary with vs, for it draweth towardes night, and the day it far paſſed. And he taryed with them. And it came to paſſe when he ſat at the table with them, he toke bread, gaue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes, brake it, and gaue it them. Then were theyr eyes opened, &amp; they knewe him. And he vaniſhed out of their ſight.</p>
                  <p>They knewe that it was Chriſtes accuſtomed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to breake the bread, and eſpecially to geue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. Yet ſhould they not haue knowen him by theſe ſignes, if he hadde not opened theyr eyes, whiche in dede was done, when Chriſte gaue thankes and brake the bread.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9767:235"/>
                  <p>Here muſte we firſt learne,<note place="margin">We muſt bee thankful to God. 1 Cor. 4</note> to giue thankes euer to god, for all his benefites giuen to vs, both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and ſpirituall.

                  <p>And theſe are the wayes that the Wyſe man ſpake of, ſaiyng:<note place="margin">Pro. 12.</note> The waye of a foole is ſtraight in his owne eyes. But what ſayth Chriſt to this? Forſoth he ſayth, that he onely is the waye, as he is in very deede and without doubt. For by him we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, righteouſnes and eternal health, and a free entraunce in vnto the father. Neither is any man admytted vnto the fathers preſence by any other mediatour or meane, but by this Chriſte onely. And he that wyll not beleue this, lette him knowe it aſſuredly, that he ſhall neuer comme vnto the father, neither be partaker of eternal life.<note place="margin">Lyfe.</note> And I beſeche you, how ſhal he comme vnto the father, that ſeketh other meanes to comme to him, then by Chriſte? Beſydes that, he rather geueth credence vnto falſe liyng, then to the truth, euen that trueth whereof Chriſte here teſtifyeth of, affirmyng him ſelfe to be the trueth. For I pray you,<note place="margin">Treuth.</note> what are all menne, all mennes doctrynes, all the ſtudyes and counſels of menne, if they bee conferred to Chriſte and his woordes? Truely all lyers, and mere lyes are all thoſe thynges that are ſpoken without the woorde of God, as the ſcripture teſtifyeth.<note place="margin">pſa. 115.</note> Pſalme Cxv. Euery manne is a lyar. But of the woorde of God the ſcripture ſayth: Thy woorde is trueth.</p>
                  <p>Nowe if the woorde of God onely bee trueth,<note place="margin">Ioh 17. pſa. 118.</note> then it neceſſarily muſte folowe, that whatſoeuer menne haue inuented without the worde of God, it is lyes &amp; mere deceyuable iuglyng. Howe can it be but truth, ſeyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> to thoſe that beleue in it,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> it is the
<pb facs="tcp:9767:243"/> power of God vnto ſaluacion and eternal health?</p>
                  <p>For to beleue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, is euen theſame as to beleue Chriſt. For Chriſt is the ſame woorde, and the woorde was made fleſhe.<note place="margin">Ihon. 1.</note> And to beleue Chriſte, is ſo excellente and noble a thyng, that it taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſynnes and eternal death, and for them geueth righteouſnes and eternal life. And thus it abydeth true that Chriſt ſayd in this place: I am the waye, the truth and the life.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, conſider alſo what Chriſte-ſayd vnto Philip, neither would Chriſt refuſe him becauſe of his imbecilitee or weakenes, but rather inſtructeth him thus: Philip, he that ſeeth me, ſeeth my father. Philip would ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father,<note place="margin">Chriſt is very God.</note> but Chriſt would graue it, not only in Philippes heart, but alſo in all other his diſciples heartes, that he is one thyng and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce with the father, one God equal with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in maieſtie and glory, of a like ſtrength &amp; wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with him. This onely excepte, that Chriſt for our infirmitees ſakes, to redeme vs was made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therefore, aſmuche as pertayneth to that, he is made leſſe then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, as it is wrytten in the viii. Pſalme:<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.</note> Thou haſt made him a lytle leſſe, vnder the dignitee of angels &amp;c. Philip (ſayth Chriſte) he that ſeeth me, ſeeth my father. And furthermore I dwel in the father, and the father in me. Beholde howe earneſtly Chriſt recyteth and bet eth into his diſciples his deuine nature and eſſence with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; alſo requireth, that thei ſhuld no leſſe beleue on him: Verely (ſayth he) al that I do or ſpeak, I do it not or ſpeake it of my ſelfe, but the father y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in me, he dothe thoſe workes. Therfore for the
<pb facs="tcp:9767:243"/> workes ſake, at the leſt beleue me, that I am in the father, and the father is in me. Furthermore, Chriſt highly prayſeth this fayth, as he moſt earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth it, &amp; ſayth. Verely, I ſay vnto you: He that beleueth in me, the woorkes that I do, he alſo ſhall do them, &amp; greatter thynges then theſe ſhall he do. He ſhall do greatter thynges then theſe, eſpecially ſeyng that Chriſt goeth to the father to receyue his kyngdome, and to ſende the holy ghoſt.<note place="margin">Fayth aſkyng in the name of Chriſt obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all thinges</note> I beſeche you nowe, who date bee ſo impudent a beaſt, or ſo ſtyffe necked, that he ſhall dare any thyng at all derogate or miniſhe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dignitee of fayth, ſeyng that to the beleuer there are made ſuch excellent promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Yea and furthermore here is made a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent promiſe vnto fayth, that is to ſay, that whatſoeuer ſhe wyl aſke in the name of Chriſt, ſhalbe geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her. Wherfore ſhal it be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the father may be glorifyed through the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. And to ſpeake briefely.

For Chriſt is the way, the truth and the life. And alſo noman co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, but by Chriſt, as our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſte hath teſtified in many places of his goſpel.

                  <p>SEyng that al thynges in the deuine ſcriptures ought well to be conſidered &amp; wayed, this may not be ouerpaſſed, but muſt diligently be noted and conſidered, that the Euangeliſt S.

<pb facs="tcp:9767:244"/> rebuked his diſciples, namely of theyr incredu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litee and vnbelief. Surely it muſt needes be, that this is an heauye and great ſynne, yea, it is to bee eſtemed and thought a verye ſpryng, welle &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn of all miſchiefe, ſeyng that our ſauiour Chriſt, euen nowe, when he would departe &amp; go to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, rebuketh it ſo earneſtly in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. For thus ſayth the Euangeliſt: At the laſt as the eleuen ſat at the table, he ſhewed himſelfe vnto theim, and rebuked their vnbeleife and hardnes of heart, becauſe they beleued not them whiche had ſeen him ryſen. Here you heare what ſynne this was, namely Incredulitee. And I pray you,<note place="margin">Vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpryng of all ſin</note> who is ſo ſhameleſſe to deny that vnbeleif is the fountayn of all euil, eſpecially if he compare fayth whereof ſcripture ſpeaketh, with her effectes, with incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litee and her frutes? For ſo comparyng them, it ſhal be an eaſy thyng to perceyue, howe good and what a great thyng fayth is, and howe excedyng an euil vnbeliefe is. The ſcripture euery where teſtifieth this of fayth, and doubtles ſuche is the nature of it that it vtterly diſpayreth of all the workes that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other dothe or can do, nor putteth no truſt or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in none of them, but alonely ſeketh at Chriſt, that righteouſnes that is of value afore God, of mere grace and mercy, without any merytes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruynges of woorkes. And this fayth is of ſuche power, that when it is true and right, it obtayneth alſo by Chriſte remiſſion of ſynnes, righteouſnes and eternall health, yea, of the chyldren of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyl, it maketh the ſonnes and heyres of God, as S.

                  <p>And doubtles thus it is with true fayth. Contrary, vnbelief hath his peculyar nature, and ſuche is his condicion, that it determyneth his owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and eternall lyfe, to come of his owne woorkes, and not of the meryte of Chriſt, whiche can not bee but to the great iniury of the paſſion of oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, by whoſe meryte onely the heauenly father is pacifyed.<note place="margin">Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulite alwayes robbeth Chriſt of his honour. 1.

For dothe not the ſcripture ſay: He is the obtainyng of grace or propiciacion for oure ſynnes? Agayne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians: Chriſte is made vnto vs (ſayth ſainct Paule) wyſedome from God and righteouſnes, and ſanctifiyng, and redempcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

For in all theyr workes they ſought nothing els, then the pha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſeis did, whome Chriſte blameth in the goſpell of Mathew, and ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> that they did their workes for this intent, that they might be glorified of menne.

The ſecond note is,<note place="margin">The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes haue their po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde.</note> that Chriſte ioyneth together the miniſterye of the worde, and baptiſme. For this wyll he teache in it, that baptiſme and the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes haue their power of the woorde, and can by no meanes bee diſſeuered from the worde. For as concernyng baptiſme, what authoritee could it haue, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde were not ioyned
<pb facs="tcp:9767:248"/> with it? Doubtles the water ſhuld be nothyng, but ſtyll remayne water. But ioyne the worde to it, and conſider well the commaundement annexed to it, then ſhall not the water be ſimple water, but as S. Paule calleth it, it is a waſhyng of regentracion &amp; of newe byrthe, and renewyng of the holy goſt. And therfore is it that Chriſt ſayth in this goſpel: Who ſo beleueth and is baptized, he ſhalbe ſaued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Signes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde.</note>Fourthly, Chriſt ſheweth here what tokens ſhal folowe vpon them that beleue. In my name (ſayth Chriſte) they ſhall caſt out deuils, they ſhall ſpeake with newe tongues, take away ſerpentes &amp;c. As he would ſay: My worde is before the world a diſpiſed worde, neither haue you whiche muſt preache it, as yet obtayned any authoritee afore men, ſo that they may receiue your preachyng and doctryne without myracles &amp; ſignes, wherfore this wyll I do: I wyll geue you power to dryue out deuils, to ſpeake with newe tonges, to heale the ſycke &amp;c. And whoſoeuer (that after your worde and doctrine ſhalbe by thoſe tokens and ſygnes confyrmed) wyll beleue you and be baptized, certaynly he ſhall obtayne remiſſion of ſynnes, and life eternal. But whoſo beleueth not, all excuſes ſet a part, ſhal be damned. Vpon this it neceſſarily foloweth, that myracles &amp; ſygnes were excedyng neceſſary at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrſt beginnyng to preache the goſpel. For if any authoritee and power ſhould be geuen to this dottryne, it was neceſſarye to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhe it and confirme it, with ſo excellent and noble myracles, lyke as the lawe alſo was before confyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by ſygnes and myracles. Notwithſtandyng thoſe ſygnes wherby the lawe was confirmed, were
<pb facs="tcp:9767:248"/> farre more horrible then were the ſygnes in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng of the Goſpell. For the ſygnes that were wrought in the beginnyng of the goſpel, were very pleaſant, if you compare them to thoſe ſygnes that were ſhewed in the beginnyng of the lawe. And the preachyng of the goſpel alſo is farre more gladder tidynges &amp; more comfortable to the heart, then is Moſes with al his preceptes &amp; lawes. Nowe in our tyme to requyre lyke myracles and ſygnes, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſittyng, vnreaſonable and vnlawfull. But if wee wyl ſo do, Chriſt anſwereth and ſayth:<note place="margin">Mat. 8.</note> This aduou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terous generacion ſeeketh a ſygne, and other ſhall not be geuen to it, but the ſygne of the prophet Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas &amp;c. For we haue the goſpel of Chriſt confirmed with miracles and ſygnes of the Apoſtles, and that ſufficiently eſtabliſhed, ſurely he that wyll not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue it, can with no miracles nor ſygnes be brought vnto the fayth.</p>
                  <p>Fyftly,<note place="margin">The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencion of Chriſt</note> we haue in this goſpell an article of oure fayth of the aſcencion of Chriſt into heauen, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> approue &amp; confirmacion of the ſame. For thus ſayth the texte: And the Lorde after that he had ſpoken vnto them, he was taken vppe into heauen, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the right hand of God &amp;c. Hetherto Chriſt had preached and taught after that he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed and ryſen agayn the thyrd daye from the dead, and truely after his reſurrection he had muche a do with the incredulitee of his Apoſtles, to whom alſo at the laſt he ſhewed what he would theim to do.</p>
                  <p>And after he had all this doone,<note place="margin">Mar 16</note> he aſcended into heauen, and ſytteth on the right hand of God, that is, he taketh to himſelfe a newe kyngdome, that he

For in it we
<pb facs="tcp:9767:250"/> ſhal plainely perceiue, what moued god to redeme vs, and by whome he would worke our redemtion. And what moued the heauenly father to doo thys? Dyd men obtaine it with their good works? Or de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerued they it by theyr honeſt conuerſacion? Truly if that time that Chriſt came into to the worlde, he wold haue iudged men accordinge to their merites and workes, it was to be feared, leaſt as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the tyme of Noe, he ſhulde haue drowned all the worlde with water, for doubteles, at that tyme ther were not very many good in al the world. For euen the Iewes which receiued the law &amp; prophets, and therfore ought to haue been more holier and better then the other nacions, theſe (I ſay) were (a fewe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept) more wretched and abhominable then anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Then needes muſt ther be a far other cauſe of our redemtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Out of loue and grace ar we ſaued</note> then the merites of man. What is it then? Chriſte anſwereth: God ſo loued the worlde. Do not you heare now, that our redemtion depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and conſiſteth vpon mere loue, grace, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion and mercy? And this loue ought well to ſtyrre vs vp and to bringe vs to faithe. For if we wel con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſider and weye this loue in our hearts, it wil ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ently teach vs, how high, ye vnſpeakable it is. For ſuerly we had deſerued by vnbeliefe and our ſinnes perpetual damnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; god mought moſt rightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue ſhed vpon vs his terrible wrath, furor, and indignacion, and haue condemnd vs vnto ꝑpetual da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nacion. but what dyd he? So mighty nowe was not his wrathe, but his loue, that not only he ſaued vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſtruction, but alſo made vs free &amp; ſafe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſynne, death, dyuel and hell. But howe did he this,
<pb facs="tcp:9767:250"/> or by what meane or mediator? Wold he do this by his angels, or by any other mediator or mean? Nay verily: But to do this, he ſent &amp; gaue freely his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten ſon. Here againe that excedyng loue is glorified, which was the cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god would redeme vs. For truely all that euer god giueth, that giueth he of grace, no merites goyng before. With this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth the ſaying of S, Paul: If when we wer ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies we were reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled to god by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of his ſon much more now that we be reconcyled, we ſhalbe ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued by his life. Here alſo in this ſaying the apoſtell co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth that god receiued vs of grace, ye when we were yet his enemies. Finally, God hath deliuered vs from our ſins &amp; from hel, &amp; hath giuen to vs eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall life by free grace &amp; loue, &amp; that hath he done by his beloued and only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonne Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, althogh our ſaluacion be gotten &amp; made perfect by Chriſt only, yet this muſt we learn to knowe, how men maye obtaine it. And thys alſo doth Chriſte manifeſtly ſhew in this goſpell: That euery man (ſaith he) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beleueth in him ſhuld not pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſhe, but ſhoulde haue lyfe eaternall. You heare in theſe wordes, whether ſaluacion gotten by Chriſte, may be receiued by works, or apprehended by faith. Without doubte, our workes do nothinge in this matter. But here muſte needes be a true faith, and an aſſured confidence and beliefe in god. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is that beliefe and faithe trewe?<note place="margin">Fayth.</note> When we diſpaire of all our workes, merites and vertues, and eſteme them as thinges that can not helpe vs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophete Eſai ſayeth:<note place="margin">Eſai. 63</note> that all oure iuſtyce or righteouſnes are as a defyled clothe.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9767:251"/>
                  <p>And thus diſpairyng of our ſelues to ſeke our righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouſnes in the merytes, paſſion and death of oure Lord Ieſu Chriſt onely, of whom Ihon the Baptiſt gaue this true teſtimonye, that he is the Lambe of God,<note place="margin">Ihon. 1.</note> that taketh away the ſynnes of the worlde.</p>
                  <p>This fayth I ſay, dothe apprehende by Chriſte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſynnes, iuſtyce and eternal life. Neither may we in this matter admyt any worke of man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we would plucke away, ſteale &amp; take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt his glory,<note place="margin">Eſai. 42</note> whiche he wyl not geue to any other, and ſo ſtealyng Chriſtes honor, burthen our ſoules vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perpetual death &amp; damnacion of our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Surely it is an vndoubted trueth, that a chriſtian man muſt do good workes, and haue an honeſt con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſacion, and with good workes confyrme &amp; allow his fayth. For who would deny this? But to ſette a fayth and confidence in thoſe workes, and to admit our merytes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of our iuſtifycacion, is in no wyſe to bee permytted. For by that meanes, grace were no grace, and that whiche before was atribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by verye right vnto the onely loue of God, that ſhould we then aſcrybe vnto our workes &amp; merites. Therfore Chriſt ſayth in this goſpell: He that bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in the ſonne of man, ſhal not be iudged. But he that beleueth not, is already iudged, becauſe he beleueth not in the name of the only begotten ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God.<note place="margin">Fayth onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> See ye that in the conflicte and battayle of the conſcience, fayth ſtandeth ſure, and is not con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dempned nor iudged?

<pb facs="tcp:9767:251"/> aſcribe quietneſſe of conſcience and ſaluacion vnto faithe, and the diſquietnes of conſcience &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petuall damnacion to vnbeliefe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdely,<note place="margin">Condem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nacion.</note> bicauſe Chriſte ſpake of iudgemente and condemnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he now procedeth and declareth what is condemnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſaith. And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnacion, that the light is come into the world, &amp; men haue loued rather darkenes then lighte. And why? For bycauſe their workes were euell. Chriſte him ſelf with his doctrine &amp; goſpel is this light,<note place="margin">The lyghte. Ioh. 8.</note> as in another place he calleth himſelfe, ſaying: I am the light of the world, Whoſoeuer foloweth me he walketh not in darknes. The darknes,<note place="margin">Darke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes.</note> is our fleſh, nature, mannes reaſon, and vnbeliefe, yea all the wiſdome &amp; prudencie of man, which doth not ſpring out of faith, but ſpring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without faith. And now I beſeche you to marke with me well, at what point our reaſon, our wiſdome and prudence is wont to ſtumble at, if it folow not the very word of god as his capitaine and leader? Surely when Chriſt came into this world, he was more redyer to ſaue &amp; help, then to condemn, nowithſtanding that the father had giuen into his hand all iudgmente. And truely the Iewes had wel eſchaped this iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment or eternall damnacion, &amp; had by faith obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned health &amp; ſaluation, if they wold haue receiued Chriſt which is the light of the world, and beleued his worde. But what doo they? They ſette more by darknes then by lyght.<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note> And as Iohn ſaithe in the fyrſt chap. of his goſpel: The light ſhined in darke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, &amp; the darknes comprehended it not. Ther was no faulte in the lyght, but a greate defaulte in the
<pb facs="tcp:9767:252"/> darkenes that receiued it not. But what foloweth nowe out of this darkenes? Forſoth this. Thoſe that neither knowlege nor learne their darkenes, nor wyll not geue Chriſt his due honor, they iudge and condempne themſelues, euen as Chriſte ſayth: Whoſo beleueth not, he is already condempned.</p>
                  <p>And truely it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeth ſo by moſt rihgteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him that is vnfaythfull.<note place="margin">Incredu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litee is iudged by his own ſelf that is, through vnbeleif</note> For inaſmuche as he doth euil, and yet can not abide the light or to be reprehended, it is right that his owne vnbeleife ſhould iudge or condempne him.

Bicauſe that they haue no paſture. yea euen the whole flocks of ſheep haue periſhed. Out of all this it foloweth, that the good ſhepeherd that came in by Chriſt, muſt needs teache the word of Chriſt, and the righteouſnes of faith by Chriſt.

                  <p>Thyrdly, becauſe Chriſt hath now deſcribed the good ſhepeherdes &amp; the euil, he nowe ſheweth howe chriſten men muſt behaue themſelfe towardes them both, that is, They muſt heare the voyce &amp; doctrine of this good ſhepeherde, to whom the keaper of the doore hath opened the doore, and they muſt knowe his voyce and folowe him,<note place="margin">Fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men do know the good preacher</note> if he go before &amp;c.

                  <p>They are accuſtomed to the good and healthſome paſtures, that is, they haue ones learned out of the holy goſpels, that in terrours of conſcience &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lege of ſynnes, there is none other conſolacion, but in the onely merytes of Chriſt. And that thoſe only be partakers of it, that take hold of it by fayth, and ſo turne it vnto their owne profite. And foraſmuche as when the good ſhepeherde commeth, he leadeth them no waye, but vnto Chriſte.

And ſainct Paule forbyddeth the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, that they admit none other goſpel then that they heard of him, inſomuch that if an Angel ſhuld come doune from heauen &amp; preache another goſpel they ought not to receiue him. The ſhepe of Chriſt knowe all this, wherfore they wyl heare none other but their owne hygheſt byſhop &amp; ſhepeherd Chriſt, whiche here ſayth: I am come that they maye haue life, yea and haue it more aboundantly.

For he not only preached penaunce, and by preachyng the law prepared a way vnto Chriſt, but alſo he ſhewed
<pb facs="tcp:9767:257"/> vnto the people Chriſt, whiche is mooſt truely that Lambe of God, that taketh away the ſynnes of the whole worlde. As alſo the holy ghoſte ſayeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by Zacharye: To geue knowlege vnto his people. But what knowlege? Knowlege of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion or health. For thereto ſerueth the preachyng of Iohn, whiche firſte through the lawe feareth the conſciences, and afterward comforteth them &amp; ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them vp by preachyng vnto them the lambe of god.

                  <p>Secondarily, in this goſpell fayth maketh Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary to ſpeake, whiche a lytle before, throughe his incredulitee was domme. And lyke as in this wee ſee howe great a ſynne vnbeleife is, euen ſo on the other part wee perceyue, howe precious and godly a treaſure fayth is. The Angel of God ſayd vnto zacharye: Thy wyfe Elizabeth ſhall beare vnto thee a ſonne. To theſe wordes ought zacharias to haue geuen credite. But what doth he?

For where as it were their duetye to aduaunce the glory of God &amp; the meryte of Chriſte, and to ſet furth the ſame, there they extoll the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
<pb facs="tcp:9767:258"/> of their own works, as that Phariſei did. Luc. 17 God (ſaid he) I thank the: For I am not as the reſidue of menne, extorcioners, vnrighteous, aduouterers, nor yet as this Publycane. Call yee this to laude and glorifie the grace of god, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Chriſt? Naye truly. Thus to boaſt, is worſe then to bee dumme. For thoughe in this prayer are heard many wordes, yet is ther not one heard, that ſeteth vp or magnifieth the grace of god or merite of Chriſte. Nowe thoughe I can ſpeake and vtter many woordes, yet as longe as vnbeliefe (that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the glory of god) raigneth in my heart, I remaine dombe afore god: as the ſcripture ſaith: Wyſdome hathe opened the mouthe of the dombe. that is to ſay: The knowledge of god maketh men eloquent, that they knowe how to gyue god his ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noure in Chriſt, to praiſe and glorifie him, and fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to confeſſe his worde. Suche an eloquent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator was Paul made when he compared his own iuſtice that he had in the lord vnto myre and dong, that by it he might ſuffre no dammage in that righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouſnes whiche Chriſte hath brought and giueth to the beleuers. And ſuch an eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t preacher was Zacharias, after that the tyme apointed by the an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gel, was fulfilled. For by and by after the circumci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion of his ſonne Iohn, he was fylled with the holy ghoſt, and prophecyed, praiſyng god, that had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that greate grace vnto him. Therfore I ſaye, where faith and the holy ghoſt are not, there muſte we needes be dum ſpiritually, yea though we ſpeak many vayne and voide wordes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdely, the Euangeliſt heere deſcribeth worde
<pb facs="tcp:9767:258"/> for worde, what Zacharias ſayd whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was fylled with the holy ghoſt, and why he ſo earneſtly praiſed and glorified the Lord his God. For thus he ſayd:</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael. To bleſſe<note place="margin">To bleſſe</note> in this place is aſmuche as to laude. For nowe in as muche as zacharias had receyued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> child promiſed to him, &amp; alſo he knewe in ſpirit what Chriſte ſhuld do, whoſe waye this chylde ſhould make ready, he praiſeth God for that ſo great and excellent a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte: Geuyng vs an enſample, that wee euermore ſhould thanke &amp; prayſe God for thoſe his benefites geuen to vs, both corporal and alſo ſpiritual. Now if ye be deſirous to heare the cauſe of this praiſyng God of zachary himſelf. For he (ſayth he) hath viſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted and wrought the redempcion of his people.</p>
                  <p>This woorde Viſite,<note place="margin">God doth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite vs ii. maner of waies</note> is in the ſcriptures taken two maner of wayes. For ſometyme God viſiteth vs in his wrath &amp; furor, as when he puniſheth our ſinnes as it chaunſed Pharao in the red ſea, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes in the tyme of Tytus and Veſpaſian the Emperor. Many tymes he viſiteth vs in mercy and grace, as it happened to the Iewes when they were brought out of Egypt, alſo when Chriſt was ſent and geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of the whiche viſitacion Chriſt himſelfe ſpeaketh &amp; complayneth,<note place="margin">Mat. 20</note> becauſe they knewe not the tyme of their viſitacion. And of this mercyfull viſitacion dothe zacharias ſpeake in this place, ſaiyng that God hath viſited and wrought the redempcion of his people. He knowlegeth alſo and eſtemeth this redempcion ſo certayne &amp; ſure, that he proclaymeth and laudeth it as done already wher in dede it was as then yet to be done in tyme commyng. And to

For doubtles, whoſoeuer ſhall beleue in this kyng, &amp; kepe his word, he ſhal aſſuredly obtain this helth. Now who could doubt in this?

<pb facs="tcp:9767:259"/> we ſhall not diſpayre of mercye for our ſinnes: for he wyll remembre that faithfull othe, that he ſware to Abraham oure father. Briefely by his owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of mere grace without deſeruinge of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, he will make vs righteous, godly and bleſſed: ſo that we beyng delyuered from the handes of our enemies, may ſerue him all the dayes of oure lyfe: not in outwarde ceremonyes and ſeruices, as in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes paſt, but in holynes and righteouſnes that is accepted before him. He requyreth the heart, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth faith, he wilbe worſhipped in ſpirite and truth and will not be fylled with outwarde woorkes that lacke faith, as men haue done in times paſt. Thus you ſee that Zacharias by the holy ghoſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the grace of the goſpell that ſhoulde come, therfore he praiſeth and glorifieth god, as one aſcer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayned, that by this grace we al ſhal be ſaued. The lorde our god gyue vs grace, bothe that wee maye know it, and alſo that for it we may giue thanks to god our father, and glorifie him for euer. Amen.</p>

Peter and the other Apoſtels, wherein they confeſſe that hee is Chriſte the ſonne of the lyuynge god. This confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſo excellente and noble, yea and ſo chriſtian, that wee dare boldlye ſaye, that where this confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not, doubteles there is no ſaluacion at all, as the Apoſtell Saynte Paule witneſſeth,<note place="margin">Rom.</note> ſaying: The hearte beleueth vnto righteouſnes, and the mouthe confeſſeth vnto ſaluacion.</p>
                  <p>Fyrſte <hi>CHRIST</hi> aſketh what opinyon the people had of hym, and whome they ſayde he was. The Apoſtels aunſwered him: Some ſaye, thou arte Iohn the Baptiſt: ſome ſaye, Helias: ſome Hieremias, or one of the prophetes. Chriſte was not ignoraunte what was ſpoken of him, and alſo he knewe it better then the apoſtels could tell him, that where the goſpell is preached, there muſte ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ariſe manye lyes, whiche are imagined not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the truth, but alſo againſt them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preach the truthe, whereout it chaunceth often times that the worlde rageth and waxeth woode with them.</p>
                  <p>Therfore nedes muſt it be, that Chriſt apoſing his
<pb facs="tcp:9767:260"/> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, ſought ſome other thinge at his apoſtels, that is to ſai, their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of faith as ye ſhal hear. For thus he ſaith: But whome ſay you that I am? The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anſwered Petre in the name of them al:<note place="margin">The fayth of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtels.</note> Thou art the ſame Chriſt the ſon of the liuyng god. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidre inwardly this confeſſion, &amp; thou ſhalt ſee that the faith of al the Apoſtels was a true and a righte faith, excepte that as yet it was not confirmed with the croſſe, and that yet the holy ghoſt was not come vpon them. Fyrſt of all they confeſſe that he is the ſame Chriſt, that is to ſaye, the ſame anointed and capitaine, whom god had longe before promiſed,<note place="margin">Eſai. 55</note> to theyr fathers, and whome they hadde ſo long time looked for, that doubtles he ſhuld come and fulfyll all ſuche thinges as the holy ſcriptures hadde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of. Furthermore alſo they confeſſe, that he is Chriſte ſonne of the lyuing god, ſente into this worlde, that by hys meryte, paſſion and deathe, all menne myghte bee made good, righteous, and bleſſed. And thus (as it is in dead conueniente to do) they confeſſe the ſame one Chriſt to be both god and man. For as concernyng his humane nature, hee is the ſonne of Dauyd, annoynted of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinge and Prieſte, and that after the order of Melchiſedech: and God hathe gyuen vnto him the ſeate of Dauid, that is, the ſpirituall kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whyche is admyniſtred by the ſpyryte, that hee maye ſytte vppon it eternallye. But as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge his godheade, he is the ſonne of the liuing god, one in ſubſtance, eſſence or being and maieſtye with the father, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither mai the father bee ſepa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rate from the ſon, nor the ſonne from the father, as
<pb facs="tcp:9767:261"/> ſainct Paule ſayth:<note place="margin">Collo. 2</note> In Chriſt dwelleth all fulneſſe of the godhead corporally. Nowe whoſoeuer with ſuche fayth, &amp; after this maner as the Apoſtles here dyd, confeſſeth Chriſte, without doubt he ſhall alſo with the Apoſtles be made partaker of eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion, as Chriſt here ſayth vnto Peter, like as to al his diſciples: Bleſſed art thou Symon the ſonne of Iona &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily we ſee in this goſpel that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion commeth not of oure ſtrengthes, but by the reuelacion of God. For aſſone as Peter had in the name of them all declared what opinion thei had of him,<note place="margin">Fleſhe &amp; bloud in ſcripture</note> by and by Chriſte ſayd: Fleſhe and bloud hath not opened it to thee, but my father which is heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Shal then our fleſhe, that is, reaſon, wyt, prudence, freewyll and the ſtrengthes of man bee of no value in matter of our iuſtificacion &amp; confeſſyng of God? Surely nothing. For without doubt here nothyng is of value, but mere grace and mercy. Nowe if it be grace, than I beleue, that I may do good woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that I can confeſſe Chriſt as the Apoſtles do in this place, nedes muſt I let fleſh contynue as fleſhe, and bloud as bloud, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inaſmuche as partayneth vnto our ſaluacion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh not only can do nothing, but alſo it can do nothyng but ſynne, as S. Ihon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Euangeliſt ſayth:<note place="margin">Ihon. 1</note> As many as receiue him, he gaue them power to be made the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of God, to thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beleue in his name which are not borne of bloudes nor of the will of the fleſhe, nor of the will of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they are borne of God. Doth not the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt here cleane refuſe &amp; reiect in matter of iuſtificacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that is borne of bloudes, or of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyl of fleſhe
<pb facs="tcp:9767:261"/> or of the wylle of man? Euen ſo it is neceſſary that we conſider here in this place the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of Peter and the other Apoſtles, that it came not of their rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon, wyſedome or frewyll. For ſurely Chriſt would in this worde dryue backe, make blunt &amp; ouerthrow our preſumpcion, and meke that pride that is borne in vs, that we ſhuld learne to diſtruſt of our ſelues and our owne ſtrengthes, and to ſeke righteouſnes and health otherwhere, then at our ſelues or in our owne workes. But where ſhuld it be ſought? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoth at him that opened vnto the Apoſtles that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of Chriſt, that is to ſay, at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, of whom Chriſt alſo ſayth in another place: Noman knoweth the father, but onely the ſonne: and noman knoweth the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, but the father only, and he to whom the father will open him.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdly,<note place="margin">A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the churche.</note> wee haue in this Goſpell a promyſe of Chriſt geuen to the churche, that is this: That the gates of hell, that is, Sathan and all power &amp; wyſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of the worlde, ſhal not preuayle againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Nowe note vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what foundacion this church muſt be buylded, to whom this excellent promiſe pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. Chriſt ſayth: Thou art Peter, that is ſtonye, that is, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſtandeſt ſtedfaſt in thy confeſſion as doth the ſtony rocke. For thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeſt and beleueſt, that I am Chriſt &amp; the ſonne of the liuyng God, that is, thou beleueſt that I am the ſauiour and redemer of the whole worlde. Wherfore nowe, ſuche fayth ſhal be in my church, that hath reſpect to me &amp; my worde and only dependeth vpon me and ſtand ſure &amp; firme in the ſame confeſſion as thou haſt done nowe. And vpon ſuche a fayth as only putteth confidence vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9767:262"/> my word, I wyll buyld my church ſo ſtrongly, that not the gates of hel, that is, what ſo euer be againſt me, other in hel or in earth, ſhal preuaile againſt it. Doubtles perſecution ſhal ariſe, and Sathan him ſelfe ſhall not ceaſe by thouſand meanes to tempte,<note place="margin">The ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of hel.</note> if it may any way be poſſible to take away the word fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my church. But he ſhal not obtain his purpoſe but ſpend his labour in vaine. And why? For I my ſelfe will be protector and defender of it. A like ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath Chriſt in Mat. Whoſoeuer heareth of me theſe wordes &amp; doth them,<note place="margin">Mat. 7</note> I wil liken him to a wiſe man that hath buylt his houſe vpon a rocky ſtone, and the rayne came downe, and the fluddes aroſe, and the windes blew, &amp; they fel with violence vpon that houſe, &amp; it was not ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for it was buil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded vpon a ſtony rock. Now ſeing that Chriſt hath with this his ſo rich &amp; excellent a promiſe prouided for his church,<note place="margin">With out the trwe churche is no ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ephe. 5</note> I pray you, who wil be ſo mad to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate him ſelfe from chriſtes church? I ſay again, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſts church, for the which as S. Paul ſaith he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelf to death, to ſanctify it, &amp; clenſe it in the fountaine of water by the word, to make it vnto him ſelf a glorious congregacion, hauing no ſpot nor wrinkell, nor any ſuche thinge, but that it ſhuld be holy and without blame.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we ſe to whom Chriſt hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keies, &amp; how far y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame power extendeth it ſelf. It was ſaid afore, that Peter anſwered in the name of al the Apoſtels, &amp; that Chriſts words were to Peter &amp; to al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Apoſtels. Seing it is ſo, ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des muſt we confeſſe, that power &amp; autorite to loſe &amp; binde, was not giuen to Peter alone, but generally
<pb facs="tcp:9767:262"/> to al the Apoſtels. Now if any wyll be contencious &amp; hold opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the power was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Peter on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, yet is his mouthe ſtopped with theſe places of Math. &amp; Iohn, where Chriſt ſaide to his Apoſtles:<note place="margin">Mat, 18 Ioh. 20</note> Whoſe ſins ſo euer ye forgiue, they be forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and whoſe ſins ſo euer ye retaine, they are retained. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be without queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diſpute &amp; ſtryue by the ſwords (as they ſaye) for the power of Peter, thei take vpon them thoſe diſputacions, not for Peters ſake, but o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>li to flatter therwith their Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man Antichriſt. But truth it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gates of hell haue ſo ſore preuailed againſt him, that euery child may perceiue eaſily, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this promiſe ought not to be wreſted &amp; falſly applied to the Roman ſeat. Beſides y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, what with his falſe doctrine &amp; his diueliſhe pride he hath ſo ſore ouerthrowen him ſelf, that his eſtima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion hath but ſmal place in the hertes of thoſe that beleue. But nowe, what is the power of the keyes? Truly nothing els but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> adminiſtracion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word &amp; ſacraments. For Chriſt hath giuen this his word and ſacraments vnto his churche. And the churche committeth the ſame power vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſters of the word, which execute this office in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whol church. Therfore wherſoeuer the worde is preched, receiued &amp; beleued, there alſo without doubt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, and that is it that here is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by loſyng.<note place="margin">To loſe and bynde.</note> And wherſoeuer the word of god is preached &amp; men beleue it not, ſurely ther remaineth perpetual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ther is no remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſins, &amp; that ſame is here vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by binding. For dout<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les the promiſe ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth here ſtedfaſtly &amp; aſſuredly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what ſo euer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſters of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde loſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth in the name of the whole congregacion, the ſame is
<pb facs="tcp:9767:263"/> loſed alſo in earthe: And what ſo euer thei bind vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon earth, the ſame is bounde alſo in heauen. And doubteles this power is not to bee contemned, for that the miniſter or prieſt dothe in this matter, hee doothe it not of himſelfe, but god himſelfe doothe it, whyche for the ſame intente, hathe gyuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs hys woorde and Sacramentes.

                  <p>Fyrſt Chriſt ſuffereth the ſinful woman to annoynt him, he ſuffereth her to waſhe his feete and to wype them, he ſuffereth her to kyſſe him, whiche no Phari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſey would haue ſuffered to bee done, eſpecially of ſuche a woman. Furthermore, when the Phariſey murmured that he receiued ſo great a ſinner, Chriſt defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth this his facte by a ſimilitude of a creditor that had two debters, the one ought fiue hundreth pence, &amp; the other fyfty.

Therfore ſeyng that we are ſo weake that we ſynne continually, therfore is it nedeful that we may haue contynually remiſſion of ſynnes in the Churche of Chriſt, and the chriſtian ought to knowe that theſe wordes: Thy ſynnes are forgeuen thee, are wordes for all tymes that neuer ſhalbe diſanulled but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynue for euer.</p>

                  <head>THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                  <p>FYrſt we ſee here in this goſpel the ignorance of the Apoſtles Iames &amp; Ihon, whiche had often heard of Chriſt, although thei did not receiue it, nor printed it in their memory, that Chriſtes kingdome ſhuld be a ſpiritual kyngdom, &amp; euen within them. Yea they were yet ſo ignoraunt, that they thought
<pb facs="tcp:9767:267"/> they ſhould without any croſſe at all been wholly promoted and made great Lordes, and ſo reigne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſte, accordyng to the pompe and glorye of this worlde. But theſe ſo fond imaginacions dare they them ſelues not vtter vnto Chriſte, althoughe they ſet not a litle by theſe, but moued their mother to go to Chriſt, to proue whether ſhe might obtayn y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they deſired. But what was their requeſt? Forſoth that in the kyngdome of Chriſte, whiche they thought a worldely kyngdome, one might haue his ſeate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right hand, another vpon the lefte hand, and ſo to enioy the honor of this worlde. Here it had been the mothers duetye, to bryng her ſonnes from this purpoſe &amp; mynde, &amp; to haue enſtructed them muche better. But in theſe matters that appertayne to the kyndome of Chriſt, the mother is as blynde &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as her ſonnes. She would gladly haue had her ſonnes promoted and made great men, euen as cuſtomably many mothers boaſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pompe &amp; ryches with their children. But the kyngdome of Chriſt is not ſo ordered, to haue in it muche po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe &amp; boaſting, but as it is a ſpirituall kyngdome, euen ſo it hath onely a ſpiritual ſcepter, namely the worde and the holy goſpel. And nowe this worde is ſuche a worde that it bringeth with it not a pleaſant lyfe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction &amp; perſecucion,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1</note> inſomuche that S. Paule calleth it the worde of the croſſe, ſaiyng: The worde of the croſſe is to them that periſhe, folye, but to vs that obtayne health, it is the power of God. If then it be the worde of the croſſe, how can we haue in the kyngdome of Chriſte, other pleaſure, pompe or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of this worlde? It is not to be loked for, but
<pb facs="tcp:9767:267"/> nedes muſt wee here ſuffre, &amp; by many tribulacions we muſt entre into the kyngdome of God, as ſainct Luke teſtifyeth of Chriſt alſo,<note place="margin">Luc. 24 Eſa. 53.</note> that he muſt needes ſuffre and ryſe agayne from the dead, &amp; ſo to entre into his glorye. But as yet Iames and Ihon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode not this, therefore they iudged it ſhould bee in the kyngdome of Chriſte, as it was in other ciuyl kyngdomes. And ſurely as theſe Apoſtles were then ignoraunt of the kyngdome of Chriſt, ſo doubtles are wee, excepte wee bee lightened by the holy ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily,<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pcion of man.</note> wee haue here alſo an example of the preſumpcion of manne. For beſydes theyr peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion whiche was againſt God, they dare alſo ſaye, that they were able to drynke the cuppe whiche the Lorde ſhould drynke, and to bee baptiſed with the baptiſme, whiche the Lorde ſhould be baptiſed in.</p>
                  <p>What iudge you of this preſumpcion? Euen ſo ſayd Peter to Chriſte, that he would go with him into death, but the ende ſhewed that it was but the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of a man. The cuppe and baptiſme of Chriſt, in this place are taken for his paſſion and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that he ſuffered, as it is alſo in the Prophete:<note place="margin">Pſal.</note> I wyll take to me (ſayth he) the cuppe of ſaluacion, and I wyll call vpon the name of the Lorde. Of this baptiſme Chriſt himſelfe ſayth: I muſt be bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſed with a baptiſme, and what pangues ſuffre I tyll it be fulfylled? To drynke this cuppe and to be baptized with this baptiſme is not in euery mans power, but there longeth to it an eſpecial connyng. But what is that? Forſoth the ſame commyng that is wrought in vs only by the holy ghoſt.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9767:268"/>
                  <p>For where ſoeuer he cometh, there muſt it needes be wrought that in tribulacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhall haue paciens But on the other part where the holy ghoſt is not, there are men none otherwiſe mynded than Peter was, when he did ſtrike of the Biſhops ſeruauntes eare. And truly theſe diſciples whiche at this tyme were thus preſumptuous, knewe but litle what the croſſe and baptiſm ment. But did god therfore caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of? No forſoth. But he beareth theyr weakneſſe and ſuffereth it very gentelye. And alſo promyſeth thme that they ſhall drinke his cup and ſuffre wyth him many tribulacions, &amp; ſo by many tribulacions at the laſte enter into the kingdome of heauen, and perpetually raygne with hym. Therfore if Chriſte caſt not of his diſciples,<note place="margin">The weak ar to be bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren with all.</note> bicauſe of their weakenes, but beareth with them with all humanitie and gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tlenes, tyll they might come to the trewe vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding, doubtles no more becometh it vs to condemn thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are weake, but muche rather it is our deuty to inſtructe &amp; teache them, and to bring them vnto better knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for as much as theſe diſciples required to ſit in Chriſtes kingdome (that thei eſtemed to be a temporall raygne) one on the ryghte hande, and an other vppon the lefte, Chriſte denayeth not his heauenly kingdome to them, only ſhewing to them of whoſe hande they ſhall receiue it: To ſitte at my right hand (ſaith he) or at my lefte hand, it pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to me to giue,<note place="margin">Chriſte ſpeaketh ſome times as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyme as God.</note> but vnto them for whome it is prepared of my father. Here note diligently, that Chriſt ſpeaketh ſometimes as a man, and ſometime as god. For this is very neceſſarye to bee obſerued
<pb facs="tcp:9767:268"/> and noted if we will at the leaſt vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. In the goſpel of ſainct Ihon Chriſt ſayth: As the father rayſeth vp the dead and geueth life, euen ſo the ſonne geueth life to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wyll. Here Chriſt maketh himſelf in all thynges equal with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father. Therfore nedes muſt this place be vnderſtand of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly nature of Chriſt. In this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t goſpel Chriſt ſayth, that onely the father and not he geueth to ſyt on the right hand or on the left. Except this be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtand of Chriſtes humayne nature, I pray you, howe ſhal theſe two ſo contrary ſentences els agre? Wherfore it is very neceſſary to note diligently (as we before admoniſhed) when Chriſt ſpeaketh as ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpeaketh as God. And alſo furthermore note this, that vnto the kyngdome of Chriſt &amp; vnto that ioy that is euerlaſting none can bryng vs, but God only, which prepared it for vs from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the worlde. This is altogether in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to geue it vnto whom he wyll. Nowe if this power bee all in him, where are then oure woorkes? where is our vertue, righteouſneſſe or holynes?</p>
                  <p>Doubtles we are bound to do good workes, ye and to be vertuous, righteous &amp; holy, for Chriſtes wyll is that oure light ſhould ſhyne before menne to the glory of our heauenly father. This is very truth, &amp; who can deny it? But here muſt wee diligently take hede, that vnto our iuſtificacion no mannes worke or merite be ioyned with al, for that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth onely of fayth, wherin alſo the grace, goodnes and mercy of God worketh altogether, whiche onely is apprehen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded by fayth. And where as this fayth is, there is alſo forgeuenes of ſynnes, righteouſnes &amp; eternall

But this haue we ſufficiently treated vpon before. Only the Lord God geue vs grace to perceiue it and retaine it in our heartes. Amen.</p>

For doute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les vnto them is the ſweard giuen and committed, (as Paule ſaith) to puniſh the euel,<note place="margin">Rom. 13</note> and defend the good and vertuous. And foraſmuche as they haue this ſweard comitted to them of god, &amp; not of theim ſelues, therfore we the reſidue of the people muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and be ſubiect to this ordinaunce of god, for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:9767:270"/> And euen ſo Chriſte in this place acknowledgeth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinges and prynces &amp; other magiſtrates muſt haue the dominion, &amp; that their dominions and regimen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes are gods owne ordinaunce, notwithſtanding he wil bi no meanes admit his apoſtels and miniſters of his worde vnto ſuche cyuyle impery. As for you (ſaith Chriſt) you ſhal not be ſo. How then? He that is the greater among you, ſhal be as the yongeſt: &amp; the chiefeſt ſhalbe as a ſeruaunt. You ſe here howe goodly Chriſt turneth all otherwiſe. The diſciples would be rulers, and Chriſt depoſeth them from al cyuile goueruenaile. The diſciples wold be lordes, &amp; Chriſt maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeruantes. Doth he this (think ye) lawfully, and did he him ſelf abſtaine from ſuch imperye and power? Yea doubteles.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> For thus wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth S.

And euen ſo Chriſt in this goſpel allegeth his own example, ſaying: Who is greater, he that ſitteth, or he that ſerueth? Is not he that ſitteth? And I am a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong you, as he that ſerueth.<note place="margin">Chriſte becomet out ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte.</note> Heare you not howe Chriſt, although he was lorde, yet he meketh hym ſelfe and is made a ſeruaunt to vs?

                  <p>They maye beare rule, but yet ſo as <hi>CHRIST</hi> bare rule in this world, and as S. Paule ſaid:<note place="margin">1 Co. 7.</note> Let men ſo eſteeme vs, as the miniſters of Chriſte, and
<pb facs="tcp:9767:271"/> diſpenſers of the myſteries of God. Surely this goſpel is a fearefull goſpel to our Byſhoppes and prieſtes. For it is to be feared, except they vſe them ſelues otherwyſe in expoundyng the worde of God then they haue done before tyme, this goſpell wyll eternally condempne them.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdly, there is in this goſpel a notable and ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellent promiſe, that Chriſt wyl ordain and appoint to his Apoſtles &amp; all his electes a kyngdome, euen as his heauenly father hath appointed him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may eat &amp; drynke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his table in that kyngdom, &amp; furthermore ſyt vpon ſeates iudgyng the xii. tribes of Iſrael. Who would not nowe gladly &amp; with all his heart lay himſelfe vnder this croſſe, to ſuffre w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt in this worlde, ſeyng that by his paſſion wee ſhal entre into that great glory? Doubtles thei are fooles &amp; without wyt, that more ſet by &amp; eſteme this temporal and ſmal ioye and voluptuous pleaſures of this worlde, then that glorious kyngdome that Chriſt wyll geue to his after this life. Truth it is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles fell in this thyng &amp; deſired this temporall glory. But what do ye thynke by this, did not they after that their had receiued the holy ghoſt, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne and ſet not a ſtrawe by this worldely glory? I long (ſayd Paule) to be diſſolued,<note place="margin">Phi. 1.</note> and to be with Chriſt. Item Chriſt is life to me, &amp; death is aduantage. He ſayd not, that he deſired to be a Lord &amp; beare rule, or to deſire the worldly glory, or that the glorye of the worlde ſhuld be to him aduantage, but this wiſheth he with moſt heartie deſire, to be with Chriſt in his kyngdome.<note place="margin">Chriſtes kyngdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</note> And here note, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſtes kyngdome is ſpiritual, and though it ſtandeth in this world &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:9767:271"/> is begon by the word &amp; ſpirit, yet ſhal it not be made perfecte and ende in this worlde, but in the worlde to come. Nowe as this kyngdome is ſpiritual,<note place="margin">To eat &amp; drynke in the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt.</note> ſo to eate and drynke in it, is alſo ſpiritual. And this is the meanyng of Chriſt: In this worlde truely you ſhall haue ſmal ioye, for you are not of this worlde, therfore the worlde ſhall perſecute &amp; ſhall hate you, but be of a good comforte, for this perſecucion ſhal ones haue an ende. I wyll then receiue you into my kyngdome, In the whiche kyngdome ye ſhal enioy perpetual peace, ioye &amp; aboundance of all ſpiritual riches. And God ſhal wype al teares fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your eyes, and death ſhal be no more, nor lamentacion, nor cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, nor ſorowe ſhalbe any more, for they are gone before. If ye haue ſowed in teares, ye ſhall reape in gladnes. And in like maner muſt we ſpeake of the thrones and iudgement. For all theſe thynges are ſpiritual. Thoſe that beleue may iudge all thynges by the woorde, and they can bee iudged of no man. Furthermore at that daye they ſhalbe wytneſſes to thoſe that beleued their woordes, that they may bee ſaued, and againſt thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beleued not their wordes to conuince theim, that they may be caſt awaye and dampned for euer. In ſumme, Chriſt promiſeth his Apoſtles, thoſe that haue folowed him, deſpiſyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pouertie of the worlde and the contempte &amp; hatered of the Phariſeys, &amp; do obay him, that thei ſhal haue his kyngdome, perpetual ſaluacion, &amp; euerlaſtyng ioy, whiche promiſe is not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles only, but to all that beleue in him, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue vnto the ende in his fayth.

By God immediatly were called in the olde teſtament Moſes &amp; the prophetes, and in the newe teſtament S. Paule. And theſe certainly approued their vocacion with good doctrine &amp; my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
<pb facs="tcp:9767:272"/> that it was of God.<note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> And mediatly from God were called the other Apoſtles, which alſo after the reſurrection of Chriſt choſe certaine other &amp; orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; appointed them to be preachers. Nowe this meane &amp; organe is Chriſt, whiche choſe in the name of his father certayne diſciples, &amp; appointed theim to preache the goſpel. Of this vocacion whiche is by certain meanes, S. Paule ſpeaketh manyfeſtly: For this cauſe I left y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in Candy (or Creta) to ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſuche thynges as want, and to ſette in euery toune byſhoppes &amp;c.

I anſwere. This may be knowen by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of him that is called. For if it be agreale to the word of God, then is that vacacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tru &amp; lawful: And ſuche a preacher is to be heard, receiued, &amp; had in good honour &amp; eſtimacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That he ought to be heard, Chriſt ſayth: Who that heareth you, heareth me. Who caſteth furth you, he caſteth furth me. That he ought to be had in good eſtimacion, S. Paule ſayth: Prieſtes that gouerne well, are worthy double honour, eſpecially ſuche as labour in the woorde and doctryne. But if he boaſt his ſendyng, miniſtery &amp; callyng neuer ſo muche, &amp; yet his doctryne be againſt the worde of God, take it for an vnfallyble truth, he is ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Sathan. And ſuche in very dede are the Papiſtes and Annabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyſtes, whoſe doctryne almoſte in euerye article is playne contrary againſt the worde of God. Nowe in this vocacion of Mathewe note theſe 11. thinges.
<pb facs="tcp:9767:273"/> Fyrſt that Chriſt called a ſymple &amp; vnlearned plain man to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of preachyng. This ſheweth plainly that God choſeth thoſe thynges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are foliſhe afore the worlde, to ſhame thoſe that the worlde hath in high eſtimacion. Another to note is, that he called vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of Apoſtleſhip a ſynner &amp; a Publican. And by this he ſheweth, that he is not a reſpector of perſonages, and alſo that he came into the worlde to ſaue ſynners.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The obe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dience of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe.</note>Secondarily, this Goſpell prayſeth and ſetteth furth the obedience of Mathewe. For by and by as he had heard the voyce &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of Chriſt, he obayed and folowed him. Yea he folowed Chriſt both ſpiritually &amp; alſo corporally. The woorde that Chriſt ſayd to him, Folowe me, not only ſounded in the eares of his body, but it alſo entred into his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart, and made him prompt and glad to forſake all thynges, and to folowe Chriſt. For if the ſpirite of God had not made that worde liuely and able to worke in his heart, he had not (doubtles) ſo ſone for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaken his office &amp; ryches. For ſurely we know right well the nature of richemen,<note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of richmen Mat 19</note> euen by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes that Chriſt himſelfe ſpake, ſaiyng: It is eaſyer for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel to go through the eye of a nedle, then for a riche man to entre into the kyngdome of heauen. And here note the power of the worde when it is ſpoken, for it is not ſo light a thyng or of ſo lytle price as ſome vngodly eſteme it. And Chriſt ſayth alſo in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place of the ſame woorde. You are not thoſe that ſpeake, but the ſpirite of your father that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth within you. You heare that Chriſte wyll not ſeparate his ſpirite and his woorde. So wee ſee in
<pb facs="tcp:9767:273"/> this goſpel, that this word of Chriſt, Folow me. did illuminat with the holy ſpirit the heart of Mathew, and wrought in him ſo great faith, deſire &amp; loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Chriſt, that by &amp; by, nothing conſidering his acompt, which yet he had not mad to the magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, he forſooke al togither and folowed Chriſt. As S. Paul ſaith: Al that is written, is writen for our learning, therfore ought wee to ſet before our eyes this obedience of Mathew, and learne by it to obei in al things that god co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth and requireth of vs. As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. If thou be called vnto matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and haue not the gift of continency, folow god, which ſaith of this thing:<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> Therfore ſhal ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forſake father and mother, and kepe himſelf vnto his wyfe, and thei ſhalbe two in one fleſh. If thou be called to any office in the common welth and ciuyle adminy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracion, be ready, faithful &amp; obedient. For this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion that is done by the ſuperior Magiſtrates, is (as S Peter ſaith) of god himſelfe.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 5</note> If thou be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the office of preaching, and art apte to that of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice, be obediente, do thy callynge. For in this caſe Chriſt ſaith: Folowe me.</p>
                  <p>Thirdely, we ſe in this goſpel,<note place="margin">Chriſte came for ſinners.</note> that Chriſt eateth &amp; drinketh with publicans &amp; ſinners, ſo that in this dede he ſheweth &amp; teſtifieth, that he came into thys worlde for ſinners. Note that I ſay, for ſiners. For though al the world hath euer bene ful of miſchiefe &amp; gylty of ſinne, neither is no man in it, but nedeth the merites of Chriſte, yet doo not all men vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande this nor acknowledge thys. And eſpecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye the indurate and hard hearted Pharaos,<note place="margin">Pharao</note> and after them the hipocrites acknoweledge it not.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9767:274"/>
                  <p>For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> indurate ſynners leade furth their lyues euen lyke beaſtes, not greatly forſyng whether there bee any other lyfe after this or no, or whether there bee any Chriſt to bryng them to that life or no.</p>
                  <p>But the hypocrites<note place="margin">Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crittes</note> that leane to their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, in dede they can talke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath to come, yet notwithſtandyng they leaue Chriſt &amp; take thus muche vpon theim ſelues, that they truſt in their owne good workes to obtaine that lyfe and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. I praye you, what good can Chriſte do to ſuche? Yea what ſhuld he do with ſuche? This fyrſt ſort of people are ſtubburne necked &amp; hard hearted, and thynketh they haue no neede of Chriſte. The other ſorte of iuſticiaryers, forſaketh the meryte of Chriſt,<note place="margin">True ſynners</note> lyke as they would deſerue heauen by theyr owne workes. Chriſt ſeyng and conſideryng this, leaueth theſe two ſortes, &amp; ioyneth himſelfe to ſuche as acknowlege them ſelues ſinners, and deſire and ſeke for tomforte and helpe. And they alſo with all their heart, with true loue and gladnes receiue him and beleue his preachyng,<note place="margin">Mich 7</note> they doubte not his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but they ſay with the Prophet Mycheas: He ſhalbe turned, and he wyll haue mercy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, and he wyll caſte all oure ſynnes into the deapth of the ſeas. Euen ſo muſt we do. Let vs adioyne our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to Chriſt as ſynners, ſhewe to him our ſynnes, and with teares require his mercye. If wee do this with a faythfull heart, ſurely in this goſpel he hath declared in dede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is ready to help ſuche ſinners. And furthermore with this his deede agreeth alſo his woordes that here he ſpeaketh vnto the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys, ſaiyng: The whole nedeth not the Phyſician
<pb facs="tcp:9767:274"/> but the ſicke. Agayne: I am not comme to call the righteous, but ſynners to repentaunce.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Euangeliſt diſcrybeth howe the Phariſeys murmured againſt Chriſt, wherein they open and ſhewe plainly that notable pryde of theyr heartes. But wherefore murmure they? Becauſe Chriſt eateth and drynketh with ſynners. O great holynes of theſe Phariſeys. Tell me I praye ye O holy hypocrites, where is it wrytten, that ſuche as knowlege themſelues ſynners &amp; do repent it, ought to bee fledde, and their company to be eſchewed? Is not this thinke you a good &amp; vertuous dede, to ſeke out agayne the loſt &amp; ſtray ſhepe, and to bryng him agayne into the right waye? But I ſee you do the cleane contrary, for ye iudge it both wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>godly. Surely Chriſt ſayd well of you in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel of Mathew: Blynd guydes, coulyng out the gnat, and ſwolowe the Camel.<note place="margin">Ma. 27</note> Ye obſerue mennes tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions, &amp; would men ſhould eſteme you vertuous and godly, yet can ye very well awaye with it, that your neighbour ſhould continue in ſynne and be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dempned. Nowe if ye were vertuous in deede, ye would ſurely neuer do ſo. For true righteouſnes, becauſe it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of fayth, and therfore alſo loueth his neighbor with all the heart, it wiſheth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all men might be vertuous, righteous &amp; bleſſed. Wherfore wyl ye knowe what ye want? Ye haue no fayth, and therfore can ye not loue your neighbour, for in very deede that is the fruite of fayth. Nowe becauſe ye lacke fayth and loue, ye haue not only no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them that be loden with ſynne and would with al their heartes be deliuered from their ſynnes, but
<pb facs="tcp:9767:275"/> alſo (euen as the nature of hypocrites and iuſticia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers is) ye diſpiſe them and caſte them frome you. But this your diſpiſing can do you no good in this behalf. Ye muſt neds take an other trade of liuing, yf ye wyll be taken for righteous. Wyll ye knowe how ſo? Learn what this meaneth that the prophet Oſeas ſaid:<note place="margin">Oſee. 6.</note> I will mercye and not ſacrifice. For all theſe outewarde woorkes, all theſe outewarde ſacrifices, profyte nothynge at all, excepte there bee preſente in the hearte a true faythe in God, and true loue to your neyghboure. Behold thus haue wee here paynted vnto vs the arrogancy and pride of hypocriſy, and furthermore howe Chriſte ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vppe the Phariſeys mouthes, and confuteth theym by the holye ſcriptures. God graunte that the aduerſaryes of the truthe in thys oure preſente tyme, maye acknowledge hys holye woorde, and beecome wyth the chylderen of god, partakers of hys heauenly kyngdome, through <hi>CHRIST</hi> our Lorde.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue againe here in this goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel an example of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitee &amp; ignorance, wherin we ſee howe pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly Chriſt beareth their infirmitee. And as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Chriſte appeareth in this Goſpell, euen ſo the affection of the Apoſtles ſheweth it ſelfe to bee exceadyng groſſe and rude, and full of ignoraunce.</p>
                  <p>For conſider what they do. They came to Chriſt &amp; ſayd: Who is greatteſt in the kyngdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? What meane they by theſe woordes? Thynke they that Chriſte ſhoulde haue a corporall knogdome
<pb facs="tcp:9767:276"/> in this worlde, &amp; promote his diſciples vnto greate lordſhips, as it is done in worldly princes courtes. Heard they euer Chriſt ſo teachi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g? Did not he ſhew them afore:<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> Ye ar bleſſed whan men ſhall rayle vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, &amp; perſecute you for my names ſake? Now how agre theſe two, to be perſecuted, &amp; to bear temporal dominion &amp; power? Truthe it is, that the Apoſtels ſhuld raign with Chriſt. But wher? In this world? Nay verely.<note place="margin">The ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gdome of Chriſt is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all.</note> For the kingdome of Chriſt is a far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a temporal worldly kingdome, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtles wel proued &amp; learned after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had rece<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holi ghoſt. But here as yet thei vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not this, and therfore they deſire to know who is grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſt in the kingdome of heauen. But what dothe or ſaith Chriſt? Suerly as he is wonte to do and ſaye. For as he often bare their infirmity, &amp; caſt them not of for their rude and goſſe affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, euen ſo doth he now at this time. He taketh a child, and ſetteth him in the middeſt of them, and ſaith: Except ye be tour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned and become as chyldren, ye ſhall not entre into the kingdome of heauen. Here in this place Chriſte teacheth his diſciple both by word and exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. For he ſetteth a child in the middeſt of them, and by and by ſheweth a cauſe why he ſo dothe, that is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was neceſſary for them to become as children. How then do childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? They lyue as nature teacheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with out ani craft or malice, thei know no pomp, no pride or any other vices of the world, only flye thei to the milke that they ſucke out of their mothers breſtes. Euen ſo muſt a chriſtian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be minded.<note place="margin">After what manner we ſhuld become children</note> For it is ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſary that he be whole dead as concernyng to the pompe, malyce, guyle, pride both ſpirituall and car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal,
<pb facs="tcp:9767:276"/> and that he only depende vpon Chriſte and his worde, and neither attempt nor preſume none other thyng, then the worde &amp; commaundement of Chriſt preſcrybeth to him. For wherſoeuer they do thus, there is no pryde, no confidence in merytes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, no guyle, no malice, but mere pouertie of ſpirit and innocency. Nowe where as is pouertie of ſpirit and innocency, there is fulfylled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaiyng of Chriſt: Whoſo meaketh himſelfe as this chylde, he is the greateſt in the kyngdome of heauens. And of this chyldehod ſpeaketh S. Paule, ſeiyng:<note place="margin">1 Co. 14</note> Brethren be not chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in wyttes, but in malyce be chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">1 Pe. 2.</note> And S.

                  <p>Secondarily, Chriſt ſheweth with what ſeueritie and conſtancy he wyll defend ſuche as come to this pouertee of ſpirit, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, he wyll take the cure of them whatſoeuer chaunce to them, be it good or euil. If any good thyng be done to theim, he wyll accepte it as done to himſelfe, as he wytneſſeth ſaiyng:<note place="margin">Mat. 25</note> What<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoeuer you dyd to one of theſe lytleones y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beleueth in me, you did it to me.<note place="margin">Zacha. 2</note> And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet Zachary is written: Whoſo toucheth you, toucheth the ball of myne eye. Alſo if any euil be done to them, he wyl accompt it as done to himſelf. For he ſayth thus: He that receyueth ſuche a childe in my name, he recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me. And he that offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth one of theſe lytleones that beleue in me, it were expedient for him, that an aſſe mylle ſtone were hanged at his necke, and he drouned in the depth of the ſea. Doth not God now defend the beleuers, &amp; is not he careful for that litle
<pb facs="tcp:9767:277"/> &amp; deſpiſed flocke that cleaueth vnto Chriſt? I pray you, who ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrin of ſuche a Lord, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thus careth &amp; defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth his ſeruantes?

And to vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are already receiued vnto faith, what can be more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, or what can we more deſire? Nowe loke howe comfortable this text is to the beleuers, when Chriſt ſaith: He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> receiueth you, receiuech me? Euen ſo feareful &amp; terrible is it to thoſe that vexe &amp; perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this poore &amp; deſpiſed people of Chriſte, whiche doth beleue in the worde. And foraſmuche as Chriſt ſhal impute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peſecucion as done to himſelfe, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out doubt it ſhal come to paſſe, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme appointed of God is fulfylled, that Chriſt wyl brydle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furor &amp; voluptuous mynde of the vngodly. But yet notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng the vngodly wyll not nowe beleue this, tyl (as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prouerbe ſayth) they haue both their handes ful, and the ſentence of perpetual dampna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion be declared againſt them, euen as you perceiue it chaunſed vnto Pharao.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdly, Chriſt ſheweth his diſciples before, that there ſhuld come ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der which ſhuld co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde: &amp; alſo inſtructeth them how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue themſelues among ſuche ſlanders. Wo to the worlde (ſaith he) for ſlanders. Nedes muſt ſlanders come, but yet wo to that man by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſlanders come. Chriſt ſheweth plainly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſlanders ſhuld co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of this world, euen as Paul ſaith: There muſt bee ſectes among you.<note place="margin">1.

But wherof ſhal this offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or ſlander ariſe, or wherin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth it?<note place="margin">Two maner of ſlander.</note> Fyrſt it ſhal come of falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb facs="tcp:9767:277"/> whiche did ariſe by &amp; by after the reſurrection of Chriſt, while the Apoſtels were yet aliue, &amp; was by conterfaict apoſtels and falſe brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taught vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the people, yea and that diligently. To omyt the other, did it not eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo chance to S. Paul, amongſt and with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? He had preached the goſpell of Chriſt to them, and had fully and ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them in the matters of faith, yea and they had receaued him with ſuche harty loue and ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent a deſire &amp; with ſuch reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.</note> that he confeſſeth that thei wold haue plucked out their eies &amp; gyuen them to him, if it had bene poſſible. Yet for all this, after his departure ther came falſe brethren, which ſet forth and taught to the Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s other maner of doctrine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paul had taught them. What ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thinke ye aroſe of this? Euen in lyke manner chanced it in our daies. God hath giuen to vs very plenteouſly &amp; richely his worde and goſpel, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuerly we ought with whole heartes to thank him &amp; laud him for that ſo great &amp; noble a treaſure. But what chanced now? When the word now did floriſhe, and thorow the wonderful goodnes &amp; gracious fauour of god, it brought forth right bewtiful frutes amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g many one, euen did ther burſt forth with their ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the Byſhop of Rome with all his Papiſticall rablement of Monkes &amp; Friers, which with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of their ſectes and doctors, dyd with all their power inuade &amp; reſiſt (ſo muche as laye in them) the plain and true word of god, to the great hinderance of the goſpel. By &amp; by vpon this folowed that peſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferous ſect &amp; doctrin of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Anabaptiſts, which made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> excedi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g wood for a time, which alſo hath don no
<pb facs="tcp:9767:278"/> lyttle hurte to the furtheraunce of Chriſtes holye worde.</p>
                  <p>What ſlaunders thynke yee haue come by theſe and many mo ſectes? Furthermore this ſlaunder is againſt loue, as when I wyll not obey the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, I will not do and paye, as other men doo and paye, neither beare the common charges as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beare, but I wyll be cleane without lawe, and haue a ſinguler prerogatiue afore al other. Of this ſlaunder Chriſte hym ſelfe ſaithe to Peter:<note place="margin">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nowe withoute doubt theſe ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhall continue in the worlde vnto the end. And eſpeciall the ſlaunderers of doctrine ſhall bee both greuous and vehemente. But what remedye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte this ſlaunder?<note place="margin">Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally are the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and feete cut of.</note> I muſte cut of that whiche woulde offende me, be it either foot, hande or eyes: that is, I muſt continue in the worde, nothing con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyderyng what ſhall chaunce, euen thoughe father or mother, brother or ſyſter, wyfe or children, kinne or affinytye, monye or ryches woulde plucke me frome it, yet muſte I ſette more by the woorde, then by all theſe. For better yt is that I forſake all thynges, be they neuer ſo deere and precious in thys worlde, and to bee ſaued afore god, then to haue all menne my friendes and be ſeparated from god. And ſeeynge that god wyll ſo extremelye punyſhe theym that rayſe ſuche ſlaunders, what thynke yee ſhall come to ſuche as for thoſe ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders
<pb facs="tcp:9767:278"/> leaue and forſake the trueth? Doubtleſſe hee ſhall puniſhe theym both alyke.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, here is a general admonicion vnto al men, that they diſpyſe none of theſe lytleones that are dead to the worlde &amp; poore in ſpirit, and knyt to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether one in Chriſt. Yea, there is alſo aſſygned a cauſe why they ſhuld beware of hurtyng them.<note place="margin">The ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones, wherfore they are not to be offended Pſal. 19</note> For their Angels (ſayth Chriſt) in heauen alway ſee the face of my father whiche is in heauen. Surely with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out doubt if God be ſo mercyful to his ſeruauntes, that he hath appointed Angels vnto this miniſtery to kepe and defende them, doubtles then this wyll pleaſe him but a lytle, if they be diſpiſed, perſecuted, troubled &amp; troden vnder foote. For ſurely the Lord is as careful for them, as if theſe thinges were done vnto himſelfe. And furthermore, he muſt nedes be diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to ſe them euil entreated, for whoſe ſake he came into this worlde and ſhedde his precious bloud. I pray you who can thynke otherwyſe in this behalfe? Shall it not prouoke his anger, that wee diſpyſe thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath redemed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his death and precious bloud ſhed? For if that loſt ſhepe be ſo deare to him, and he ſo entyrely loued it, that he left nyntye and nyne in the wyldernes, and ceaſſed not ſeekyng tyll he had founde it, why ſhould wee then either perſecute or trouble that ſheepe? Surely he may ſuffre it, but without doubt he wyl not leaue it vnpuniſhed. Furthermore he ſayth: It is not his fathers wyll that one of theſe lytleones ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhe. Are not theſe ſtrong reaſons that might well refrayne vs from perſecutyng of our chriſtian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? Theyr angels (ſayth Chriſte) whiche muſt

Surely this is an vndoubted truth, that there is beſydes fayth no woorke in the worlde, nor none can be, that ſhalbe acceptable vnto God, ſaue onely charitee and loue of my neighbour, of the whiche Chriſt ſpeaketh in this Goſpel.

The worlde holdeth and defendeth with to the and nayle, the righteouſnes of workes, but your doctrine ſhall be cleane repugnant &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for if ye will purely and ſincerely preach my worde, ye ſhall maintayne and defende the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of faith. And if ye wyll do ſo earneſtly as it ſhall be your duety, nedes muſt ye caſt of all that is in the worlde, that is, all carnall wiſedome, vertu, righteouſnes, ſtrength, freewill. as ye knowe that I haue doone.

And furthermore, the holye ghoſte ſhalbe ſente for the ſame purpoſe, to rebuke the worlde as I haue done. Now if for this gentle rebukinge the worlde ſhall hate you, and take all thynges to the worſte, and imagyne all manner of myſchiefe againſt you, knowe you that euen ſo did the worlde by me. If I had approued and alowed their workes, as I dyd reproue &amp; diſalow them, I had hadde the high Prie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes myne eſpeciall good friendes, with the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeis and all the Iewes: but when I would needes do myne office truly, and fully accomplyſhe my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, needes muſt I loſe all their frendeſhippes, and alſo for that cauſe ſuffre ſo many of their falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſacyons, checkes and rebukes. Nowe, woulde you ſpeede better than I? There is alſo and other cauſe why the worlde can not loue you: For you are not of this worlde. If you were of this world, the world woulde loue that whiche is his owne, but bicauſe you are not of the world, but I haue choſen you out of the worlde, therfore the worlde hateth you. You
<pb facs="tcp:9767:283"/> heare in this place, that if the world hate you, it ys an euident argument, that you ar not of the world. And euen ſo ſaith S Paule:<note place="margin">Gala. 1.</note> Yf I ſhuld pleaſe men I ſhuld not be Chriſtes ſeruant. And a lyke teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny doth Chriſt giue his apoſtels, that thei ar not of this world. Why ſo? For thei ſhal rebuke the world reproue and damn the carnal iuſtice of the world, &amp; earneſtly affirm &amp; preach the righteouſnes of faith, for they ar not of this world. that is, thei ſeek not a carnall iuſtice as the world dothe, their confidence is not in their good workes as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlds is, but thei earneſtly preach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> merits of Chriſt, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only cauſe of our righteouſnes &amp; ſaluacion. Now bycauſe the world can not bere this, ther is mortall warre and contynuall hatred betwene theym and the worlde, euen as Chriſte ſaithe here agayne in this goſpell: But all theſe thinges ſhall they doo to you, for my names ſake, bicauſe they knowe not him that hath ſente me. Fynallye. Bycauſe the worlde knoweth not the father, therfore knoweth it not the ſon. And becauſe it knoweth not the ſon, neither knoweth it them whom the ſonne hath ſent.

                  <p>WE muſte verye diligently (deere chriſtians) obſerue and note in this goſpell,<note place="margin">The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſte is to teache &amp; to ſaue.</note> that when Chriſte ſaw the people and his diſciples were come vp to him, he maketh vnto them a godly and, fruteful ſermon, whiche comprehendeth in a maner all thinges that are neceſſary for a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man to do ſpiritually before god.

                  <p>Fyrſt,<note place="margin">Ghoſtly pouerte.</note> Chriſt promiſeth the kingdome of heauen and ſaluacion to the poore in ſpirite. But what ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth it to be poore in ſpirite? The poore in ſpirit are thoſe, that cleaue to no tranſitory thing of thys worlde, that ſet their confidence in no creature, that are deade vnto the worlde, and leaue and whollye put their faith in Chriſt and his worde. Vpon ſuch poore ſhall the ſpiryte of the lorde reſte, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Eſaias ſaith. Theſe poore receiue the goſpel,<note place="margin">Eſa. 66 Mat. 11</note> as our Sauiour ſaid to the diſciples of Iohn. And furthermore ſuche pore men are ſo deerely beloued of god, that he promiſeth peculier gyftes and ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler graces to ſuch as do them ony benefite, as ye maye reade in the 40 Pſal. And ſuche pore are not proud in the ymaginacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their own hartes. Thei contemn no man, thei diſpiſe no man, but are lowly and meeke, euen frome the hearte. Wherefore they ſhal haue as Chriſt promiſeth here, the kyngdome of heuen, wher as all hypocrites that ſwell by their outward righteouſnes, &amp; for the ſame preferre them ſelues before al other, ſhal haue perpetual fire and euerlaſting damnacion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt promiſeth to thoſe that morne, comforte, heere by the ſpirite, and in the worlde to come eternal life and the kingdome of heauen.

Let vs therfore apply &amp; compare one w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the other, &amp; ſe how thei do agree. For as the vineyard is not ordained for to beare thornes and thyſtels, but that the vine trees ſhould be planted in it for to beare fruites, ſo the church is ordained, not to floriſhe with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riches
<pb facs="tcp:9767:289"/> of this worlde (whiche verely are thornes) but for to plante Chriſt in it. For as the huſband man doth make cleane the ground of the vyneyard, and doth plante in it vyne trees, and doth hedge it round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute, maketh a preſſe, and buyldeth a tower in it, purgeth &amp; maketh cleane the braunches, that they may brynge furth fruite plentifullye, ſo likewyſe God the father hath choſen to him ſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among men a church, in the whiche he hath planted Chriſt his ſonne, whiche garden he alſo hath ſtrengthned with an inuincible ſtone, namely Chriſt, againſt whiche ſtone or tower eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gates of hell can not preuaile. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as when the godly be regenerate in Chriſt, ſo he dothe purge and make cleane their heartes that they may bryng furth fruite. In this vyne tree there be ii. kyndes of braunches or ſortes of men, for ſome haue a ſhape of godlines &amp; ſeme to beleue in Chriſt, and to be ſpecial in Chriſtes chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, hearyng ſermons, receiuyng the ſacraments, &amp; do many good woorkes, and yet they do not truely beleue in Chriſt, nor yet their woorkes do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede out of a true fayth.

Some there be that are godly, &amp; euen as they verely beleue in Chriſt, ſo verely they worke by faythe, &amp; brynge furthe fruit, that alway doth remayne. And this difference ought chiefly to be marked. The vngodly &amp; wicked ſpeaketh moſte peſtiferouſly of Chriſtes churche, for becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſe in it many impure &amp; wicked men, for whoſe ſakes
<pb facs="tcp:9767:290"/> they thinke that the churche of Chriſt is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true church, nor that it hath not the true Goſpel. But they that ſo do condempne the true churche, forbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is admixed with euil perſons, are here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine condempned with this ſermon of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>For truely Chriſt ſpeakyng of the braunches, doth not ſpeake of thoſe, that with their open profeſſion be ſeparated and deuided from the churche, as the Iewes and Turkes, but of thoſe whiche be or ſeme to be in the vyne tre, Chriſt. And of theſe he maketh two ſortes,<note place="margin">Two kynde of braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</note> ſome of theim be barraine, &amp; ſome fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. By the whiche he teacheth very plainly, that the churche here vpon yearth hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mixed with her many euil perſons, whiche although they ſeme to bee the very membres of Chriſt, yet they bee but braunches to be cutte away, and to be caſt into the fyre.

But whyleſt the man was a ſlepe his enemy came, and did ſowe cockle among the wheate. And againe, the kyngdome of heauen is likened vnto a lytle nette that is caſt into the ſea, whiche did pull vp all kynde of fyſhes. And in another place. A cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne man went into the mariage, whiche had not his mariage garment. And ſainct Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayd. They went out from vs, but they were not of vs. But I pray you what becommeth of theſe braunches that bryngeth furth fruite?

                  <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>darily, Nowe are ye cleane (ſayth Chriſte) becauſe of the worde that I haue ſpoken vnto you. I beſeche the, what meaneth theſe wordes? Be the Apoſtles pure and cleane braunches, when as yet they were ſynners, and ready immediatly to leaue their mayſter Chriſt, and to deny him? I ſay ye are cleane, not forbecauſe of your owne fleſhe, whiche is yet ſynfull, nor for the puritie &amp; cleaneſſe of your righteouſnes, whiche is myngled with muche im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puritne and vncleanes, but for the <hi>worde</hi> which I haue ſpoken vnto you (ſayth Chriſt,) That is, for my goſpel, whiche I haue ſhewed vnto you, that is to ſay, that I am the very true Meſſias, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for ſynne, whiche with my death hath kepte you from death, whiche hath taken vpon me the horriblenes of hell, that I might deliuer you from hell, yea, and I haue purchaſed for you of God my father, that he ſhall take you for his children, ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes and heyres of the heauenly kyngdome. And this is the worde, by the whiche man is verely purifyed &amp; made cleane, if it be receyued by fayth. Fyrſt who ſoeuer doth receiue this woorde of the Goſpell by fayth, he is acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted before God for very iuſt, pure, and holy, and that not for the workes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whiche wee doo, but onely for Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, receyued by fayth. S.

<pb facs="tcp:9767:291"/> beyng a meane. Therfore, whoſoeuer doth beleue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of the goſpel of Chriſt, although that ſynne doth ſtyll remayne in his fleſhe, yet ſinne is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto him, ſo that he nowe may be iuſt before God, not with his owne righteouſnes, but with an others righteouſnes, that is, the righteouſnes of Ieſu Chriſte, whiche is geuen vnto him by fayth. For bleſſed is that man, to whom God doth not im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pute ſynne. Furthermore, whoſoeuer receiueth the woorde of the Goſpell by faythe (whiche is geuen by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt) whiche ſhal mortifie the remna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the fleſhe,<note place="margin">The houke is the holy ghoſt.</note> &amp; ſhal ſo rule ſynne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhal not reigne in our mortal bodyes. Therfore the holy ghoſt is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very true houke, with the whiche the braunches be purged, and that by the woordes of the Goſpell. Fyrſt that by fayth wee may bee accompted before God, iuſt for Chriſtes ſake: Secondly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the deedes of the fleſhe may be mortified, &amp; the luſtes of ſynne be quenched. And although it can not be done in this life, that ſynne wholly might be pulled vp out of the fleſhe, yet it may bee done through the holy ghoſt, that ſynne ſhal be paired away, and the fruit of it deſtroyed, ſo that we ſhall not walke after the fleſhe, but after the ſpirite. In concluſion, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer doth receiue the worde of the goſpel by fayth, he ſhalbe troubled with many afflictions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuſions in this worlde. Chriſt ſayth: If they haue perſecuted me, they ſhall perſecute you. And in an other place: We muſt by many tribulacions (ſayth he) entre into the kyngdome of God.<note place="margin">Tribula<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and trouble is the houke alſo.</note> Wherfore, afflictions are to be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted among thoſe houkes with the whiche the heauenlye father dothe purge
<pb facs="tcp:9767:291"/> his braunches. The keper of the vyneyard cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth away the braunches with an houke, not for to hurte theim and ſo to periſhe, but that they might bryng plenteouſly furth fruite.<note place="margin">Tribula<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion is ſent, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?</note> So God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſendeth to the godly the croſſe and afflictions, not that they ſhould periſh, but that they ſhould be preſeuerued. To this man is ſent a croſſe, that he ſhould bee admoniſhed of the ſynne yet remainyng in his fleſhe: to that man, becauſe he ſhould walke in his vocacion, leaſt ſynne ſhould reigne in his fleſhe: to another, that he ſhould be an example for the amendement of other men, and ſo to other for other cauſes, not for this cauſe, that they ſhould vtterly periſhe, but that they ſhould bee deliuered from periſhyng, and to attayne eternall health.</p>
                  <p>When we bee puniſhed with the croſſe and miſery, wee muſt go to the vyneyarde, wee muſt call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce the cuttyng knyfe or houke of the ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the vineyarde, and wee muſt knowe, to what ende they cutte in the vyneyarde, and that ende is thende of affliction, which is accuſtomed to chance to the godly, that is to ſay, that they ſhould not bee caſt into the fyer, and ſo to peryſhe in the flame, but that they ſhould bee purged, and that as well they might bryng furthe more plentyfully fruite, as to bryng furth and increaſe. And that it is euen ſo, that they whiche remayne in the true vynetree, whiche is Chriſte, might bee purged or made cleane, and bryng furth muche fruite, Chriſte ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto it and ſayth: Tarrye in me, and I in you: As the braunche can not beare fruite of him ſelfe, except he tarry in the vynetree. &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9767:292"/>
                  <p>This is as it were an handſonme concluſion of the fyrſt exhortacion. I haue ſayd that I am the verye true vyne tree. I haue ſayd, that the braunche that taryeth in me ſhall bryng furth fruite plentifully, Therfore I beſech you, that you would tary in me, foraſmuche as I do tarye in you, and ye ſhal bryng furth muche fruite. But tell me, howe ſhall wee tarye in Chriſte? Do wee tary in him, when wee do tary in tradicions and commaundementes of men? No truly. Chriſt ſayth: They worſhip me in vayne with the commaundementes of men. But we tarye in Chriſt, when we tarry in the woorde of Chriſt by fayth. Whoſoeuer beleueth in me (ſayth he) kepeth my worde, and my father ſhall loue him, &amp; we ſhall come vnto him, and make our dwellyng place with him. What benefite dothe chaunce to him that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth in Chriſt? Fyrſt Chriſt taryeth in him, for he ſayth: Tarye in me, &amp; I in you. What thyng better or more greatter doeſt thou ſeke? Whoſoeuer hath Chriſt, hath all the treaſure of heauenly goodneſſe. Sainct Paule ſayth: Ieſus Chriſte is made vnto vs from God, wiſedome, righteouſnes, holynes, &amp; redemption. Therfore whoſoeuer hath Chriſt, is made before God, iuſt, holy and righteous, and is deliuered from all trouble.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdly, let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider what fruite the Apoſtles brought, whiche taryed in Chriſt. Although the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles a lytle whyle after did forſake Chriſt, by fliyng away from him, and deniyng of him, yet for all that by and by they dyd repent, and they were ſo ioyneth in couple with Chriſt, that they did alway continue in him. Wherfore they brought furth at
<pb facs="tcp:9767:292"/> the fyrſt beginnyng muche fruite, by preachyng of the goſpell of Chriſt. After that they had receyued the gyftes of the holy ghoſt on Whytſonday, they did ſprede abrode the Goſpell throughout all the worlde, &amp; gathered together the churche of Chriſt, not onely of the Iewes, but alſo of the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>Sainct Paule ſayth, that the goſpel was preached among all creatures, which were vnder heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And againe: The goſpel hath increaſed euen through the whole worlde. Furthermore, beſydes many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther godlines and good workes, they brough furth plentyful fruite, in doyng of great miracles, which they did in the name of Chriſt, whereby Chriſt did floriſhe, and the authoritee &amp; truth of Gods worde was highly commended. They ſhewed themſelues towardes the Magiſtrates, as they ought to doo. They loued their neighbours accordyng to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of charitee. Thei gaue not them ſelues to glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony and riotous bankettynges, or to vncleanes &amp; wantonnes. Fynally, they did aſwell priuately as openly leade a godly life, and ſuffereth very muche trouble &amp; perſecucion for the woorde of God. They were tryed by many mockes and ſtripes. They wer caſt into priſons and chaynes. They ſuffered much hunger &amp; penury, at the laſt, they ſuffered all kynd of perſecution and death, and yet they forſoke not their vocation, but the more they were perſecuted, the more ſtronger did they confeſſe Chriſt. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did the rather optayne with Chriſt his heauenly kyngdom. And this is the fruites which the Apoſtles brought furth, when they did tarye in Chriſt. Euery man hath his owne fruites tariyng
<pb facs="tcp:9767:293"/> in Chriſt. For he that tarryeth in Chriſt, he euen at the fyrſt beginnyng bryngeth furth fruite by the callyng and confeſſyng the name of Chriſt, both by his honeſt behauiour and with al kindes of godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and vertue, by obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, chaſtitee, temperance, ſobrietie, by true biyng and ſellyng, &amp; by other ſuch kyndes of vertues. And theſe be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miracles whiche bee nowe required of the godly. And vndoubtedly whoſoeuer doth folow theſe vertues in this world, bryngeth furth great miracles. There is ſo great a multitude of vnſhamefaſt menne, of gluttons and deceyuers in this corruptible worlde, that it is no leſſe a miracle to liue among theim, iuſtly, chaſtly, ſhamefaſtly, and ſoberly, then it was in tymes paſt to make a blynd man to ſee, or els to raiſe vp a dead man. To conclude, whoſoeuer remayneth in Chriſt bryngeth furth fruite, by ſufferaunce and pacience in the croſſe, in aduerſitee and afflictions. Let him not forſake his vocacion, although he be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but let him rather be encouraged by affliction to maintayne his vocacion, that he may openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that he knoweth Ieſus Chriſt to be his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes and health. What ſhould bee the let, but he that remayneth in Chriſt, ſhal bryng furth much fruite? He that doth not tarrye in Chriſte, doth not bryng furth fruite.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, let vs well vnderſtand that he ſayth: Without me ye can do nothyng, that is, ye can not bryng furth any profitable or healthful fruite, nor ye can do no good worke that is acceptable to God, except ye beleue in me, &amp; tary by fayth in me. What is it to be and to tarrye in Chriſte? Surely it is to
<pb facs="tcp:9767:293"/> beleue Ieſus Chriſt to be borne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> virgin Mary, to be very Chriſt, &amp; this Chriſt to be the only propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatorye and ſacrifice for our ſinnes, whiche hathe made reconciliacion for thee to the father, and for whoſe ſake thou art made his ſon by adoption, and heire of the heauenly and celeſtiall kingedome. By this faith thou art accepted for Chriſts ſake of god: by this faith thou art accompted afore god as iuſt: by this faith, what workes ſo euer they be that thou doeſt, whether they be of publicke or priuate voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (here we do not ſpeake of ſinne, which canne not be doone by faithe) they be accepted of god, not as the honeſt doynges of Ethnikes, but as the true godly workes vnto euerlaſting lyfe. And here wee muſte not thynke that god dothe giue eternall lyfe to the godlye for their merytes ſakes, but that the godly taketh the righte of etrrnall lyfe by faith, for Chriſtes ſake. Therfore thoſe workes that be done by this faith, bee called the fruites of eternall lyfe, partely, bicauſe they be done to declare our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, for that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue receiued the right of the kyngdome of heauen and eternall lyfe, and partely that they be rewarded with rewardes in the lyfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtynge. Who ſo euer ſhall bide in Chriſte that is. ſhall beleue that hee is accepted of God, and to be his ſonne adoptiue for <hi>CHRISTES</hi> ſake, hee what ſo euer he dothe, althoughe it ſeeme neuer ſo excellent and pleaſaunt, pure and holy, it profiteth nothinge before god.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, they that do not remaine in Chriſte are thoſe, which know the name of Chriſt, leadeth a wicked lyfe, walketh after the fleſhe, and obeyeth
<pb facs="tcp:9767:294"/> to ſinne. If Chriſte doth not tary in him, how ſhall he tary in Chriſt? S. Iohn ſayth: Hee that ſaieth I knowe him, and doth not keepe his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, is a lyer, and there is no truthe in hym. And againe: Whoſoeuer ſhal ſay: I loue god, and ſhal hate his brother, is a lyer. And S. Paul ſaith: If there be any man that ſhall not prouide for his, and eſpeciall for his houſholde, he is worſe then an Infidele. It is very plaine, that thoſe whych leade a wycked lyfe, althoughe they boaſte themſelues of the name of a chriſtian, yet for all that they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye not in Chriſte. What ſhal be come of thoſe that remain not in Chriſt? Euen verely that thing, that belongeth to the vnfrutefull braunches, which are in the vine tree.<note place="margin">Ezec. 16</note> Theſe beynge cut away frome the vine tree, are profitable to no buyldinge as other woode and tymbre is, but beynge caſt out a dores, they wyther, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be gathered togither, and caſt into the fier, and there be burned.

What can a chriſten ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lacke, hauinge this firme and ſure promiſe? for he ſayeth: What ſo euer ye ſhal aſke. Is ther any kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple vpon earth, that hathe ſo rich and ſo excellent a promiſe, as a true chriſtian hathe? No trewly. But let vs not ſwarue, the wordes of Chriſt are dligent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to be conſydered, and rightly to be vnderſtand. Chriſte dothe not ſimpely ſaye: What ſo euer yee wyll aſke, it ſhall bee doone vnto you. But thys ſayinge hath hee putte before theſe woordes: If yee abyde in me, and my woordes abyde in you. wyth the whyche woordes is to bee vnderſtande, that then ſhall bee vnto vs, what ſo euer wee wyll and ſhall aſke. Therefore, hee that wyll and aſke thoſe thynges whyche bee contrary vnto Chriſtes wordes, and the whych be prohybited by the words of the Lorde, he tarieth not in Chriſt, nor the words of Chriſt abide not in him, wherefore this promiſe pertaineth not to him.

Therefore thoſe that ſhall call vppon God, and ſhall aſke annye benefytes of
<pb facs="tcp:9767:295"/> him either corporal or ſpiritual, wee ought to looke into his goſpel and promiſes, that we may know of theym, what thinges hee wylleth vs to wyll and to aſke. Of corporall thinges Chriſt ſayth: Your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father knoweth, what nede ye haue of all thoſe things. Seke therfore firſt the kingdome of god, &amp; his righteouſnes, and al theſe things ſhalbe caſt vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to you. Of ſpiritual things and heauenly goodnes the goſpel of Chriſt is ful of them. As for this thing came Chriſt, ſpecially, that al which beleueth in him ſhuld not periſh, but haue euerlaſti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g life. Therfore thou haſt here put vnto thee, the treaſure of al good things, which thou doeſt not wyll onely &amp; aſke, but alſo thou maiſt claim, if thou doeſt tarry in Chriſte; and his wordes tarry in the.

I (ſayth ſainct Paule) haue pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, Apollo hath watered, but God hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the increaſe.

                  <p>Fourthly, wee lerne here the great daunger and perſecucion that Chriſt hath called &amp; ſeth his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in. For he ſayth: Go your way, behold, I ſend you furth as Lambes among the Wolues. It is not vnknowen howe fearce, cruel, and rauenyng a beaſt a Wolfe is of nature againſt the vnarmed Lambes. This ſaiyng of Chriſt what is it els, but as he would ſay: I ſend you wholly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out weapon among extreme and cruel enemyes? What peace, tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quilitee, or comfort ſhall a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loke for amonges ſuche enemies?<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phecies of Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias are not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</note> Surely this ſaiyng was neceſſary to be ſpoken to the Apoſtles and diſciples of Chriſt For when they ſhould be ſent of Chriſt to preache,
<pb facs="tcp:9767:297"/> that the kyngdom of Meſſias was nere at hande &amp; already come, they were put in remembrance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions and afflictions that ſhould happen vnto them, becauſe they ſhould not imagyne and dreame of a corporal kyngdom of Meſſias: and that they ſhuld perceiue alſo, that when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophetes ſettyng furth the peaceable, ioyfull &amp; happye kyngdome of Meſſias, they did not ſpeake of the outward peace and tranquilitee of this worlde, but of the ſpiritual maieſtie &amp; perpetuall felicitee, then preached by the Goſpell, and afterwarde to be manyfeſted vnto the whole worlde. For if the kyngdome of Chriſte were of this worlde, Chriſt ſhould not haue ſent his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles as ſhepe among Wolues, but rather he would haue brought it to paſſe, that they ſhuld haue been had in great reputacion, and ſhould haue been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably entreated and receiued, as it had become ſuche a great kynges Ambaſſadors. But nowe he ſetteth theim furth into many daungers, ſaiyng: They ſhall deliuer you vp (ſayth he) to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> counſails,<note place="margin">Mat. 10</note> and ſhall ſcourge you in their ſynagoges.<note place="margin">Mar. 13</note> And ye ſhall be brought to the head rulers and kynges for my ſake. And in another place he ſayth:<note place="margin">Ma. 14</note> They ſhall put you to trouble and ſhall kyll you, and ye ſhal be hated of all people for my names ſake.</p>
                  <p>Theſame that Chriſt preacheth here to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, partaineth to all other priuate perſons, bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng the wordes of the Apoſtles. For euery manne in his owne vocacion is ſent like a Lambe among Wolues. And neceſſarily wee muſt entre through many afflictio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s into the kyngdom of God. For we muſt bee euer on the ſufferyng ſyde. The Lambe
<pb facs="tcp:9767:298"/> hurteth not, he ſpoyleth not, nor deuoureth. But he is hurt, ſpoyled &amp; deuoured. So likewyſe the ſmal and weake flocke of Chriſt is of other iniured, ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and troubled. We muſt (I ſay) by many tribula<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cions enter into the kyngdome of heauen.</p>
                  <p>Alſo we are here commaunded not to be carefull, but euery man in folowing his vocacion muſte bee diligent to execute the ſame, truſting and beleuing that god ſo wil prouide and care for vs, that we ſhal lacke nothinge. as it apeareth in his apoſtels and diſciples whom he ſente forthe without any wallet, ſcrip or ſhooes, yet thei did lack nothing, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did aſk the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whether they had lacked ani thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g or no, thei anſwered: No. Therefore let vs (as Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth vs) ſeke firſt the kingdom of god, and the righteouſnes thereof, and all theſe thinges ſhal be miniſtred vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Filftey, here is to be noted, that we muſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diligently do that which we are bidden to do, and not to be withdrawen from it by no manner of wayes, nother vnder pretence of loue and friende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe, or viſityng our friends, and ſaluting them, but (as the diſciples were commaunded) to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and not to be ſtayed or returned by any ſuch meetings &amp; communings by the way, ſo neglecting our offyce. After this manner did Eliza the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete ſaye vnto his ſeruaunt: If ye mete any man, ſalute him not: and if anye ſalute the, anſwere him not againe. Wherwith commaunding him, that he diligentlye and ſpedely ſhuld do and performe hys maiſters buſines and commaundement. Wherfore let euery man ſo apply and take heede in his voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:9767:298"/> that god thereby may be glorified and prayſed To whome with the ſonne and holy, ghoſt be all honour, worlde without ende. Amen.</p>
